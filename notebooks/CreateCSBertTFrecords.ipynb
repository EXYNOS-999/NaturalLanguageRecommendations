It supports two different contention-based channel access mechanisms, namely distributed coordination function, which offers fair service for every station, and the enhanced distributed channel Access (EDCA) for offering service differentiation among the stations. In this paper, we study the throughput performance of the IEEE 802.11ad EDCA mechanism under saturated traffic conditions using both analytical and simulation models. A novel five-dimensional Markov chain developed is used for analytically modeling the throughput behavior of the IEEE 802.11ad EDCA in the presence of virtual antenna sectors, high-gain directional beamforming, and presence of contention and contention-free access periods. Using this developed analytical model, the effect of the number of sectors, number of stations, arbitration inter-frame space, packet length, and minimum contention window size on the throughput of the four different access or service categories present in the EDCA under saturated traffic conditions, is investigated. When compared with the simulation outcomes, the proposed analytical model accurately analyzes the network performance by achieving less than 4% error.',\n",

The final decision is made by a fuzzy expert system, which improves the accuracy rate provided by a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) classifier taking into account the audio labels assigned by the GMM classifier to past audio frames. Comparison between WLPC-SC and most timbral features proposed in [8] is performed, aiming to assess the good discriminatory power of the proposed feature.

Exact expressions of the effective capacity at a given quality of service (QoS) exponent are derived for the renewal processes with either constant or variable reward. The simple expressions reveal meaningful insights, such as the monotonicity and bounds of the effective capacity. The analytical results are then applied to evaluate the cross-layer throughput for diverse hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) systems, including fixed-rate HARQ (FR-HARQ, e.g., Type I HARQ, HARQ with chase combining (HARQ-CC) and HARQ with incremental redundancy (HARQ-IR)), variable-rate HARQ (VR-HARQ), and cross-packet HARQ (XP-HARQ). Furthermore, aiming at maximizing the effective capacity via the optimal rate selection, it is disclosed that the VR-HARQ and XP-HARQ attain almost the same performance, and both of them perform better than FR-HARQ. In contrast, most of the prior outcomes approximate the effective capacity with the lack of insightful discussions that hampers the optimal design of HARQ systems. Finally, the numerical results corroborate the analytical ones.',\n",

The paper proposes an approach called Mashroom+ to support human-machine interactive data mashup, which can better handle uncertainties during the semantic matching process. To improve the correctness of matching results, an interactive matching algorithm is proposed to synthesize the matching results from multiple automatic matchers based on user feedbacks. Meanwhile, to avoid bringing too much burden on users, we utilize the entropy in information theory to measure and quantify the ambiguities of different matchers and calculate the best times for users to participate. An interactive integration environment is developed based on our approach with operator recommendation capability to support on-demand data integration. Experiments show that Mashroom+ approach can achieve good balance between high correctness of matching results and low user burden with real data.',\n",

              " 506588: 'In recent years the attack vectors in the network world have increased many fold with the increased usage of Internet and with the exponential growth of various applications. Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is one of the most sought after system by security experts in safeguarding the network from both external and internal attacks. NIDS works mainly in two modes: Online and Offline. Online or real-time NIDS, such as Snort, Bro, etc., examines the packet structure to find intrusions, if any, and alerts the administrator. On the other hand, offline NIDS logs the packets flowing to and from the network, constructs features based on connections, and creates a dataset. Such NIDS datasets are used in research purposes for applying data mining, machine learning, evolutionary algorithms, etc., to detect attacks. KDD CUP 99 is one such widely used popular IDS dataset. KDD CUP 99 dataset is obsolete because many of the attacks performed to create the dataset do not exist now. Moreover, the features constructed do not pertain to network activities. It is a mixture of host based as well as network based features. So, the need for a new dataset, conforming to the present network activities and attack vectors, is inevitable. This motivated us to come out with a NIDS dataset, SSENet-2011 dataset, in this paper. SSENet-2011 dataset was constructed using Tstat tool. A real time experiment was performed, the network packets were captured, features were constructed, and the dataset was created. The created SSENet-2011 dataset was compared with the KDD CUP 99 dataset. From the experiments it is evident that a closed and secluded network such as SSENet and Tstat tool help researchers in developing and analyzing a new dataset which reflects the changing scenario of network activities.',\n",

              " 395583: \"In multi-tenant shared clouds, applications of different tenants compete for the shared network and thus suffer significant unpredictability of performance. The progress is an essential metric to measure the overall data transfer rate of a tenant and to indicate how fast a tenant can complete data transfer. Most previous work of network allocation or schedule focus on achieving the tradeoff among the fairness, performance, and efficiency. They, however, often do not make each tenant achieve noticeable progress. In this paper, we motivate to maximize tenant's progress by using information about the underlying network and traffic patterns of tenants' applications. To illustrate the feasibility of maximizing progress, we develop a network sharing framework for multi-tenant datacenter, by exploiting the benefits of careful placement of tenant's applications. Furthermore, the tenants' progress and network utilization would be further improved without impacting performance isolation, if the bandwidth demand of each application can be rescheduled. Our evaluation results show that our method provides higher tenant progress and better tenant-level performance than HUG.\",\n",

Whereas most of the previous approaches operate on hyper rectangles, we propose a representation based on half-spaces. Consequently, the left-hand side and right-hand side of an association rule does not contain a conjunction of items or intervals, but a weighted sum of variables tested against a threshold. Since the downward closure property does not hold for such rules, we propose an optimization setting for finding locally optimal rules. A simple gradient descent algorithm optimizes a parameterized score function, where iterations optimizing the first separating hyperplane alternate with iterations optimizing the second. Experiments with two real-world data sets show that the approach finds non-random patterns and scales up well. We therefore propose quantitative association rules based on half-spaces as an interesting new class of patterns with a high potential for applications.',\n",
              " 339728: 'Vibrational control algorithms have been shown their potential in achieving stability and improving the performance of engineering systems by injecting high-frequency dither signals. This paper presents the robustness analysis of nonlinear vibrational control systems while disturbances exist. The linearization matrix of the averaged system is assumed to be Hurwitz such that the nonlinear vibrational control system is vibrationally stabilizable without disturbances. In the presence of disturbances, the domain of attraction can be estimated by constructing a quadratic Lyapunov function, which provides an upper bound of disturbances that the system can handle. For all initial points from the domain of attraction, all disturbances constrained within the estimated bound, a Lyapunov-based sampling method is applied to show that the solutions converge to an ultimate bound, which is a function of the bound of disturbances. That indicates the stabilized vibrational control systems are robust to a class of additive and bounded disturbances. As an illustrative example, an inverted pendulum stabilized by the vibrational control algorithm is shown to have the ability to track a vertically moving target without a feedback, in which moving speed is regarded as a disturbance. Numerical results support the theoretic findings.',\n",

The server provides the missing functionality but never the missing code. As long as the missing functionality is hard to reverse-engineer, the application cannot run without validating itself to the server. Current software-splitting techniques scale poorly to the Internet because interactions with the remote server are synchronous: the application must frequently block waiting for a response from the server. Perceptible delays due to network latency are unacceptable for many kinds of highly-reactive applications, such as games or graphics applications. This paper introduces virtual leashing, the first non-blocking software-splitting technique. Virtual leashing ensures that the application and the server communicate asynchronously, so the application's performance is independent (within reason) of large or variable network latencies. Experiments show that virtual leashing makes only modest demands on communication bandwidth, space, and computation\",\n",

While they make excellent memory devices, recently they have also been used to accomplish logic functions. The properties of MTJs are greatly different from those of electronic devices like CMOS semiconductors. This makes it challenging to design circuits that can efficiently leverage the spintronic capabilities. The current approaches to achieving logic functionality with MTJs include designing an integrated CMOS and MTJ circuit, where CMOS devices are used for implementing the required intermediate read and write circuitry. The problem with this approach is that such intermediate circuitry adds overheads of area, delay and power consumption to the logic circuit. In this paper, we present a circuit to accomplish logic operations using MTJs on data that is stored in other MTJs, without an intermediate electronic circuitry. This thus reduces the performance overheads of the spintronic circuit while also simplifying fabrication. With this circuit, we discuss the notion of performing logic operations with a non-volatile memory device and compare it with the traditional method of computation with separate logic and memory units. We find that the MTJ-based logic unit has the potential to offer a higher energy-delay efficiency than that of a CMOS-based logic operation on data stored in a separate memory module.',\n",

While the existing traffic-aware systems independently compute the fastest route based on the current and/or historical traffic condition, they ignore the fact that the uncoordinated decision based on the identical traffic view could lead to new congestion in the future. We propose a novel online route planning system called Predictive Traffic Assignment or PTA that exploits previous planned routes to accurately predict their impact on future traffic. Based on the dynamic prediction, PTA system computes the optimal route for each vehicle. Because it accounts for the impact of the previous vehicles, PTA coordinately assigns different routes to vehicles such that the traffic load is balanced among these routes. We present the models of PTA and implement PTA with an efficient algorithm. We conducted extensive simulation studies based on actual city maps. Simulations show that PTA significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art online and offline approaches. We also show that PTA could result in great saving in travel time, fuel consumption and GHG emissions even if only a small portion of vehicles use PTA.',\n",

              " 211002: \"The vehicle collision warning system (CWS) is an important research and application subject for vehicle safety. Most of this topic's research focuses on autonomous CWSs, where each vehicle detects potential collisions based entirely on the information measured by itself. Recently, an alternative scenario has arisen. This scenario is known as cooperative driving, where either the vehicle or the infrastructure can communicate its location, intention, or other information to surrounding vehicles or nearby infrastructure. Since installing a low-cost global-positioning-system (GPS) unit is becoming a common practice in vehicle applications, its implications in cooperative driving and vehicle safety deserve closer investigation. Furthermore, the future trajectory prediction may lead to a straightforward approach to detect potential collisions, yet its effectiveness has not been studied. This paper explores the engineering feasibility of a future-trajectory-prediction-based cooperative CWS when vehicles are equipped with a relatively simple differential GPS unit and relatively basic motion sensors. The goals of this paper are twofold: providing an engineering argument of possible functional architectures of such systems and presenting a plausible example of the proposed future-trajectory-based design, which estimates and communicates vehicle positions and predicts and processes future trajectories for collision decision making. In this paper, common GPS problems such as blockage and multipath, as well as common communication problems such as dropout and delays, are assumed. However, specific choices of GPS devices and communication protocol or systems are not the focus of this paper\",\n",

The SZ and HAZ consist mainly of ferrite, widmanstatten ferrite, ferrite+cementite aggregates, and martensite. FSP considerably refined the microstructure of the steel by means of dynamic recrystallization mechanism and formed a volumetric defect-free basin-like processed region. The ferritic grain size of the steel decreased from 25 µm in the coarse-grained state to about 3 µm in the fine-grained state, and the grains formed were separated mostly by high angle of misorientation with low density of dislocations. This microstructural evolution brought about a considerable increase in both hardness and strength values without a considerable decrease in ductility. Ultrafine-grained microstructure formed around and just beneath the pin increased the hardness of the steel from 140 Hv0.3 to about 245 Hv0.3.

However, compared to single-level parallelism, nested-parallelism is much more complicated for programming since its configuration space of degree of parallelism is more complicated. Nowadays parallel programming models such as OpenMP only have naive support for nested parallelism, and programmers need to specify number of threads for each parallel task explicitly to get a reasonable performance. Such method has two drawbacks. First, it is a complicated job to write code to figure out appropriate configurations for different environments and contexts. Second, the runtime system lacks sufficient global information about threads allocation to make optimal decision on task-core mapping, which easily causes significant performance loss. To deal with such problems, we propose NestedMP, a set of directives which extends OpenMP. NestedMP adopts a model that propagate available threads on task tree in a top-down way, which provides global information about threads allocation for runtime system when high level parallel tasks are launched, to help it make locality-aware task-core mapping decisions. On the other side, instead of configuring number of threads explicitly, programmers control that by policies defined in NestedMP. We have written a few benchmarks by NestedMP, which shows NestedMP makes the code more concise on most cases. We have implemented NestedMP in GCC 4.8.2 and tested the performance of these benchmarks on a 4-way 8-core SandyBridge server. The result shows NestedMP improves the performance significantly over GCC's OpenMP implementation.\",\n",

However, the beamforming gain is actually frequency-dependent in wideband mmWave MIMO systems. This phenomenon is called beam squint which will deteriorate the system’s performance when traditional beam selection methods are used. To solve this problem, we propose a wideband beam selection method for mmWave MIMO systems relying on lens antenna arrays. First, we select one beam with the maximal energy averaged over the whole band for each user and then we sequentially select the beams that contribute the most to the sum-rate. The performance analysis of the proposed wideband beam selection method is also presented. Numerical results show that the proposed method achieves higher sum-rate and energy efficiency compared with its traditional counterparts.',\n",

The relative entropy is considered as a security measure for the indistinguishability of the CS-based cryptosystem. By developing an upper bound on the entropy, the security analysis reveals that the presence of wireless channels and additive noise contributes to reducing the relative entropy of the cryptosystem. Consequently, the CS-based cryptosystem with circulant matrices can guarantee wireless security in terms of the indistinguishability, as long as the channel gains and the plaintext-to-noise power ratio of an adversary are kept to be low for a long keystream and a short ciphertext.',\n",

However, the quality of wireless links is affected or even jeopardized resulting in transmission failures by many factors like collisions, fading or the noise of environment. In this paper, we propose a reliable multicast protocol, called CodePipe, with energy-efficiency, high throughput and fairness in lossy wireless networks. Building upon opportunistic routing and random linear network coding, CodePipe can not only eliminate coordination between nodes, but also improve the multicast throughput significantly by exploiting both intra-batch and inter-batch coding opportunities. In particular, four key techniques, namely, LP-based opportunistic routing structure, opportunistic feeding, fast batch moving and inter-batch coding, are proposed to offer significant improvement in throughput, energy-efficiency and fairness. Moreover, we design an efficient online extension of CodePipe such that it can work in a dynamic network where nodes join and leave the network as time progresses. We evaluate CodePipe on ns2 simulator by comparing with other two state-of-art multicast protocols, MORE and Pacifier.

We first provide evidence that Mandarin passives can have not only control structures (as previously assumed) but also the possibility of a raising derivation involving A-movement, thus ruling out control as the sole reason for the absence of smuggling.

Three perspectives are examined: the server perspective, the client perspective, and the system perspective. Candidate reuse metrics are proposed from each perspective.',\n",
              " 412229: 'An active research topic in recent years is to design tone mapping operators (TMOs) that convert high dynamic range (H-DR) to low dynamic range (LDR) images, so that HDR images can be visualized on standard displays. Nevertheless, most existing work has been done in the absence of a well-established and subject-validated image quality assessment (IQA) model, without which fair comparisons and further improvement are difficult. Recently, a tone mapped image quality index (TMQI) was proposed, which has shown to have good correlation with subjective evaluations of tone mapped images. Here we propose a substantially different approach to design TMO, where instead of using any pre-defined systematic computational structure (such as image transformation or contrast/edge enhancement) for tone mapping, we navigate in the space of all images, searching for the image that optimizes TMQI. The navigation involves an iterative process that alternately improves the structural fidelity and statistical naturalness of the resulting image, which are the two fundamental building blocks in TMQI. Experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.',\n",

However such modeling is a fundamental challenge as channels are typically unknown a priori and only available through data samples. In this work we aim to characterize the amount of channel modeling that is required to determine the stability of networked control tasks. Our most significant finding is a direct relation between the sample complexity and the system stability margin, i.e., the underlying packet success rate of the channel and the spectral radius of the dynamics of the control system.',\n",

However, very few previous works in the literature put their focus on predicting personality from Chinese texts. As Chinese texts are much more difficult to delimit than English texts, it poses more challenges in recognizing personality from Chinese texts. In this paper, we attempt to classify the personality traits from Chinese texts. We collected a dataset with posts and personality scores of 222 Facebook users who use Chinese as their main written language. Then, we used Jieba, a Chinese text segmentation tool, as the tokenizer for the task of text segmentation, and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) as the learning algorithm for personality classification. Our experimental results show that the performance in precision and recall can be significantly improved with the help of text segmentation. Moreover, exploiting side information, such as the number of friends, could improve the performance further. One interesting finding from our experiments is that extraverts seem to write more sentences and use more common words than introverts. This indicates that extraverts are more willing to share their mood and life with others than introverts.\",\n",

First, for each possible V2I–V2V spectrum reusing pair, we analyze the queueing system for the V2V link and derive the packet loss probability and average packet sojourn time under fixed power allocation. Then, an optimal power allocation is derived for each possible pair. Afterwards, we optimize the spectrum reusing pattern by addressing a polynomial time solvable bipartite matching problem.

A warning system evaluates a driver's risk and gives an alert when the risk exceeds a threshold, where the risk criterion employed is crucial. Our previous studies have shown the effectiveness of the 2nd-order time-to-collision (TTC) that assumes a constant acceleration motion for vehicles and calculate the time until a collision. However, the criterion considers such a case to be safe that a driver follows the preceding vehicle at a constant distance, no matter how small it is. Obviously, this does not agree to a driver's feeling of risks. To take this issue into account, we make an assumption that a driver always expects the preceding vehicle's sudden brake and propose the brake-assumed 2nd-order TTC, which is the 2nd-order TTC when the preceding vehicle decelerates with fixed brake strength. This idea is simple but difficult to determine the parameters, especially the brake strength. We propose two methods for estimating a driver's imaginary deceleration. One is called the CV minimizer and the other is called the transferred deceleration. In order to confirm the effectiveness of the methods, we apply the methods to the driving data collected originally under unconstrained conditions. In the experiments they show almost the same results where the criterion explains the brake use as well as the throttle use.\",\n",

Automatic routine discovery goes beyond low-level activity recognition such as sitting or standing and analyzes human behaviors at a higher level (e.g., commuting to work). With recent developments in ubiquitous sensor technologies, it becomes easier to acquire a massive amount of sensor data. One main line of research is to mine human routines from sensor data using parametric topic models such as latent Dirichlet allocation. The main shortcoming of parametric models is that it assumes a fixed, pre-specified parameter regardless of the data. Choosing an appropriate parameter usually requires an inefficient trial-and-error model selection process. Furthermore, it is even more difficult to find optimal parameter values in advance for personalized applications. In this paper, we present a novel nonparametric framework for human routine discovery that can infer high-level routines without knowing the number of latent topics beforehand. Our approach is evaluated on public datasets in two routine domains: a 34-daily-activity dataset and a transportation mode dataset. Experimental results show that our nonparametric framework can automatically learn the appropriate model parameters from sensor data without any form of model selection procedure and can outperform traditional parametric approaches for human routine discovery tasks.',\n",

It is shown that for MIMO two-way relaying, the minimum distance of the effective constellation at the relay becomes zero when all the rows of the channel fade coefficient matrix belong to a finite number of vector subspaces referred to as the singular fade subspaces. The singular fade subspaces can be classified into two kinds based on whether their harmful effects can be removed or not: (i) the removable and (ii) the non-removable singular fade subspaces. It is shown that network coding maps obtained by the completion of appropriate partially filled Latin Rectangles can remove the harmful effects of all the removable singular fade subspaces. For 2λ-PSK signal set, the removable and non-removable singular fade subspaces are characterized and, it is shown that the number of non-removable singular fade subspaces is a small fraction of the total number of singular fade subspaces and this fraction tends to zero as the constellation size tends to infinity.

The DSKF-based algorithm uses the derivatives of the stator-flux components as mathematical model and the stator-voltage equations as observation model so that only a vector of four variables has to be offline optimized. Numerical results, carried out using a low-speed training test, show that the proposed DE-based approach is very promising and clearly outperforms a classical local search and three popular metaheuristics in terms of quality of the final solution for the problem considered in this paper. A novel simple stator-flux-oriented sliding mode (SFO-SM) control scheme is online used in conjunction with the optimized DSKF-based algorithm to improve the robustness of the sensorless IM drive at low speed. The SFO-SM control scheme has closed loops of torque and stator-flux linkage without proportional-plus-integral controllers so that a minimum number of gains has to be tuned.',\n",

The method offers two major advantages. First it evaluates the closed loop transfer function, which inherently takes into account the impedance mismatch between the elements of the loop and the nonlinear behavior of the active device. These factors affect the loaded quality factor of the frequency stabilization element, as well as the location of frequency at which minimum phase noise is obtained. Secondly the method uses complex quality factor to estimate the frequency of best phase noise performance. Unlike the conventional quality factor which only uses the derivative of phase response, complex quality factor takes into account both amplitude and phase variations and provide better insight for low noise design. It has been shown experimentally that complex quality factor changes significantly for saturated loop. By using complex quality factor of saturated loop, phase noise performance can be more accurately predicted compared to the methods which do not take saturation effects into account.',\n",

              " 109884: \"Noise is a challenge for process mining algorithms, but there is no standard definition of noise nor accepted way to quantify it. This means it is not possible to mine with confidence from event logs which may not record the underlying process correctly. We discuss one way of thinking about noise in process mining. We consider mining from a `noisy log' as learning a probability distribution over traces, representing the true process, from a log which is a sample from multiple distributions: the `true' process model and one or more `noise' models. We apply this using a probabilistic analysis of the Heuristics Miner algorithm, and demonstrate on a simple example. We show that for a given model it is possible to predict how much data is needed to mine the underlying model without the noise, and identify differences in the the robustness of Heuristics Miner to different types of noise.\",\n",

The optimization task for a truck is formulated as an open-loop, finite-horizon optimal control problem, which is repetitively solved as part of a model predictive control framework. The truck dynamics is represented as a hybrid nonlinear model and a multi-point boundary-value problem (MPBVP) is obtained using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, the Pontryagin minimum principle for input constraints, interior boundary conditions for state constraints and interior point constraints for gear shifts. The MPBVP is solved numerically by a multiple shooting algorithm. Results are validated in simulations and compared to an ordinary speed controller.',\n",

The main obstacle in the use of full-duplex in signal transmission is the self-interference. In this paper, we propose a system model where a copy of the transmitted signal is obtained by an auxiliary receiver and afterwards subtracted from the signal at the ordinary receiver in the same User Equipment. This requires the knowledge of the correlation in between the channels of the two receivers. We propose to use a Kalman filter for channel estimation, which is derived to estimate the correlated channels of both receivers in the presence of two types of noise. The first one is the additive Gaussian noise, while the second one is the transceiver noise which results from impurities of the transmitter and receiver components. This scenario allows for a more comprehensive analysis of self-interference cancellation. We utilize the bit error rate of the transmission to study its performance in the cases of perfect channel state information, Kalman filter channel estimation and Least Square Estimation (LSE). It is shown that, the bit error rate when using Kalman filter is lower than when using LSE. The combination of using a Kalman filter as the channel estimator together with an auxiliary receiver also enhances the data rate.',\n",

Since the traffic forwarding capability of each node varies according to its level of contention, ideally, a node should not transmit more packets to its relay node than the corresponding relay node can forward. Instead, each node should yield its channel access opportunity to its neighbor nodes so that all the nodes can evenly share the channel and have similar forwarding capabilities. In this manner, nodes can utilize the wireless channel effectively, and further increase the end-to-end throughput of a multihop path. We propose a fully distributed contention window adaptation (CWA) mechanism, which adjusts the channel access probability depending on the difference between the incoming and outgoing traffic at each node, in order to equate the traffic forwarding capabilities among all the nodes in the path.

It is shown that capacity can be constrained when users are located in the city centres, despite longer line of sight paths to users out in the suburbs. The effects of temporal changes in the spatial traffic distribution are investigated. It is shown that bandwith requirements can be reduced if the platform moves to track these changes.

Embedded memories, often implemented with 6T SRAM cells, serve as a key component in many of these systems. However, conventional SRAM cells are prone to side-channel leakage power attacks. To provide resiliency to these types of attacks, we propose a symmetric 8T SRAM cell which incorporates two more transistors than the conventional 6T cell to significantly reduce the correlation between the stored data and the leakage currents. To demonstrate the improved security of the suggested memory array, both cells were implemented in a 65-nm CMOS technology.

The cooperation among secondary users (SUs) improves the sensing performance and spectrum efficiency. In this paper, we study the traffic-demand-based cooperation strategy of SUs in multichannel CRNs, in which each SU makes its own cooperative sensing decision according to its traffic demand. When an SU has high traffic demand, it can choose to sense multiple channels in the sensing period and obtain more chances to use spectrum resources. If an SU has no data to transmit, it can choose not to perform spectrum sensing. We formulate this problem as a nontransferable utility (NTU) overlapping coalitional game. In this game, each SU implements a cooperation strategy according to its expected payoff, which takes into account the expected throughput and energy efficiency. We propose two different algorithms, namely, an overlapping coalition formation (OCF) algorithm and a sequential coalition formation (SCF) algorithm, to obtain a coalition structure. The OCF algorithm guarantees that the coalition structure is stable, whereas the SCF algorithm has lower computational complexity and less information exchange among SUs. Moreover, when being assigned a certain channel, SU implements an adaptive transmission power control scheme to further improve its energy efficiency. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithms achieve a higher aggregate throughput than the disjoint coalition formation algorithm from the literature, where each SU can join only one coalition.',\n",

In database systems, conflicting access requests from multiple transactions have to be serialized. There are various ways to order multiple conflicting access requests like FIFO and timestamp ordering (TO) schemes. For example, an object is exclusively used by each transaction in locking protocols. In scheduling algorithms, highly prioritized processes are performed before lower ones. Thus, it is critical to discuss which access request should be performed before another. In this paper, we postulate that an access request issued by a more significant subject for a more significant purpose should be performed prior to less significant access requests. In the role-based access control model, a role is a set of access rights, which shows a job function in an enterprise. A subject is first granted a role from another subject. Only a subject granted a role can issue an access request in the role. In this paper, the significancy of subject and purpose is defined in terms of roles and authorization relations. Here, there are two views, subject-oriented (SO) and purpose-oriented (PO) views to order transactions. A method issued by a subject with more significant roles should be performed before another conflicting method issued by a less significant subject in the SO view. A transaction issued by a subject is associated with a subset of roles granted to the subject, which is named purpose. A method with a more significant purpose should be performed before another method in the PO view. In this paper, we discuss how to combine the SO and PO views into a unique SPO view to order conflicting access requests.',\n",

Shoot through is avoided by proper control over the dead time and protecting the drive stage from heavy inductive transients. The motor inductive current has been kept continuous for smoother operation and effective torque. Further, an adaptive control scheme for sensing the current requirement and the dynamic load experienced by each motor is developed for an active feedback and subsequent corrections for individual wheels, when negotiating uneven loading. Timing requirements from the implemented scheme do not mandate a strict real time deadline or a signal processing approach from the on-board computer and hence can be ported into a compact system on an 8 bit microcontroller.

In this study, classical filter analysis and design methods are employed to derive a complex interpolator for maximizing the resistible echo delay in a channel estimator on the basis of the correlation between frequency domain interpolating and time domain windowing. The coefficient computation of the complex interpolator requires a key parameter, i.e., channel length, which is obtained in the frequency domain with a tentative estimation scheme having low implementation complexity. The proposed complex adaptive interpolator is verified in a simulated digital video broadcasting for terrestrial/handheld receiver. The simulation results indicate that the designed channel estimator can not only handle SFN echoes with more than 200 μs delay but also achieve a bit-error rate performance close to the optimum minimum mean square error method, which significantly outperforms conventional channel estimation methods, while preserving a low implementation cost in a short-delay channel.',\n",

One of such challenges is caused by wheel slippage and another is due to the strict need for ensuring WMR safety. This letter proposes a new trilateral teleoperation scheme for haptic teleoperation control of a WMR (slave) with longitudinal slippage. In this teleoperation system, a virtual model (predictor) of the slave WMR is utilized at the master site to guide the human operator to issue more effective commands and, by mediating between the master and the slave WMR, ensure that unsafe maneuvers are not performed by the WMR. Besides compensation for the WMR/terrain's nonpassivity caused by the slippage, a shared control is proposed for the system. Theoretically, the system's stability is shown via its passivity and it is shown that the force felt by the human operator is approximately equal to the forces applied by the environment of the predictor plus that of the slave robot, which is a satisfactory performance outcome. Experiments of the proposed WMR teleoperation system demonstrate that it results in stable trilateral teleoperation with a satisfactory tracking performance. The predictor at the master site is shown to compensate for lack of precise information about the slave robot.\",\n",

              " 607313: 'This paper proposes the novel secure information sharing among wireless nodes by the physical layer security based on multi-antenna null steering. For secure wireless communication, the secure information like the common key of cypher should be shared among nodes before data transmission. However, in wireless adhoc network, the untrusted relay node may steal the data under relay process. In the proposed sharing, a source node and two sink nodes send the information conveying signal and the artificial noises to relay station, simultaneously for avoiding decoding the information in the untrusted relay. After amplifying and forwarding relay, the two nodes do not decode the information from the received signal without removing artificial noises. The untrusted relay constructs the null steering with two antennas for removing the artificial noise. Since the channel transfer functions through which the two artificial noises are passed are common, the null points to two sink nodes can be constructed. As a result, the two nodes can remove the artificial noises. This null steering is mirroring null steering. The computer simulation shows the effect of proposed information sharing in terms of secure capacity.',\n",

Standard hysteresis experiments operate at ac excitation, room temperature, and no applied mechanical stress. This is the extent of variables considered by some electromagnetic simulation programs.

It has been shown that closed-loop control can be superior to reduce those oscillations than open-loop control in the literature. For the closed-loop control, the conventional way of implementing sliding mode control (SMC) algorithm is forward Euler method, which results in numerical chattering in the control input and output. This paper proposes an implicit Euler implementation scheme of super twisting observer and twisting control for a commercial MEMS mirror actuated by an electrostatic staggered vertical comb (SVC) drive structure. The famous super-twisting algorithm is used as an observer and twisting SMC is used as a controller. Both are discretized by an implicit Euler integration method, and their implementation algorithms are provided. Simulations verify that, as compared to traditional sliding mode control implementation, the proposed scheme reduces the chattering both in trajectory tracking output and control input in presence of model uncertainties and external disturbances.

Five different packet scheduling algorithms have been applied to the FB type WDM OPSes. It is observed that OPSes incorporated with shortest packets first (SF) and oldest packets first (OF) algorithms will yield better switching performance. Next, we observe that packet scheduling algorithms have stronger influence on switching performance when they are applied to the primary output buffers than to the re-circulated buffers. Moreover, we demonstrate that by appropriately employing the suitable packet scheduling algorithms in the primary output buffers and re-circulated buffers, the benefits of packet scheduling algorithms could be significant. Hence, the switching performance of FB type WDM OPSes could be greatly improved simply by employing the appropriate packet scheduling algorithms',\n",

First, its two-tier hierarchical framework supports customizable application-specific scheduling policies, hence, FIT is very flexible. Second, FIT is lightweight in terms of minimizing the thread number to reduce preemptions and memory consumption while at the same time ensuring system schedulability. We propose a novel Minimum Thread Scheduling Policy (MTSP) exploration algorithm within FIT to achieve this goal. Finally, FIT provides a detailed real-time schedulability analysis method to help check if application's temporal requirements can be met. We implemented FIT on MicaZ motes and carried out extensive evaluations. Results demonstrate that FIT is indeed flexible and lightweight for implementing real-time applications, at the same time, the schedulability analysis provided can predict the real-time behavior. FIT is a promising scheduling system for implementing complex real-time applications in sensor networks.\",\n",

The constraints are enforced along the surfaces of e.g. elastic bodies under consideration. Standard constraint algorithms include penalty methods, Lagrange multiplier methods and combinations thereof. For complex scenarios, a major part of the solution time is taken up by operations to identify points that come into contact. This paper presents a novel approach to model frictionless contact using high order finite elements. Here, we employ an especially designed material model that is inserted into two- respectively three-dimensional regions surrounding contacting bodies. Contact constraints are thus enforced on the same manifold as the accompanying structural problem. The application of the current material formulation leads to a regularization of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. Our formulation can be classified as a barrier-type method. Results are obtained for two- and three-dimensional problems, including a Hertzian contact problem. Comparisons to a commercial FEA package are provided. The proposed formulation works well for non-matching discretizations on adjacent contact interfaces and handles self-contact naturally. Since the non-penetrating conditions are solved in a physically consistent manner, there is no need for an explicit contact search.',\n",

In such work, a crucial role is played by the notion of attack between arguments, and the notion of attack is well-studied. There is, for example, a range of different approaches to identifying which of a set of arguments should be accepted given the attacks between them. Less well studied is the notion of support between arguments, yet the idea that one argument may support another is very intuitive and seems particularly relevant in the area of decision-making where decision options may have multiple arguments for and against them. In the last decade, the study of support in argumentation has regained attention among researchers, but most approaches address support in the context of abstract argumentation where the elements from which arguments are composed are ignored. In contrast, this paper studies the notion of support between arguments in the context of structured argumentation systems where the elements from which arguments are composed play a crucial role. Different forms of support are presented, each of which takes into account the structure of arguments; and the relationships between these forms of support are studied. Then, the paper investigates whether there is a correspondence between the structured and abstract forms of support, and determines whether the abstract formalisms may be instantiated using concrete forms of support in terms of structured arguments. The conclusion is that support in structured argumentation does not mesh well with support in abstract argumentation, and this suggests that more work is required to develop forms of support in abstract argumentation that model what happens in structured argumentation.',\n",

We say that a point p covers, or stabs, an arc A if p is contained in A. Each point has a weight and a capacity that determines the number of arcs it may cover. The goal is to find a minimum weight set of points that stabs all the arcs. CAS models a periodic multi-item lot sizing problem in which we are given a set of production requests each with its own periodic release time and deadline. Production takes place in batches of bounded capacity: each time unit t is associated with a capacity c(t) and weight w(t), where c(t) bounds the number of requests that can be manufactured at time t, and w(t) is a fixed cost for manufacturing any positive number of requests up to c(t) at time t. The goal is to find a minimum weight periodic schedule. We present a polynomial time algorithm for CAS that is based on a non-trivial reduction to Capacitated Interval Stabbing. Our approach applies to both hard and soft capacities. We also consider two variants of CAS in which some arcs may remain uncovered: in the partial variant there is a covering requirement g, and the goal is to find a minimum weight set of points that covers at least g arcs; and in the prize collecting variant each arc has a penalty that must be paid if this arc is not covered.',\n",

This novel combiner concept contains the angular compensation associated with a conventional grating rhomb as well as a feature that mitigates pupil shear. A proof-of-principle version of a conventional combiner was fabricated and tested at TRW, and the limitations of this approach will be discussed and contrasted with the more novel compensated grating rhomb technique. 1. Semiconductor laser diodes are attractive sources for a space-based laser communications system because they have been shown to be reliable at low powers, are easily modulated, and are relatively compact with minimal drain on the spacecraft prime power subsystem. However, until the advent of reliable, diffraction-limited diode arrays, the highest power single emitter currently available in sample quantities is Matsushita Electric Corporation's (MEC) 100 mW Buried Twin Ridge Substrate (BTRS) 860 nm GaAlAs laser with a nonabsorbing mirror (NAM) structure.1 Higher power single emitters, broad area devices, and linear arrays have demonstrated reliability but are not diffraction limited. Most cross-orbital and interorbital links currently envisaged wilJL require an order of magnitude more usable output power. Several incoherent power combining (summing) schemes have been discussed in the literature.2/ 3 The approach taken here is similar to that of Minott4 at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. The difference between the TRW and NASA instruments is subtle and has to do with our system level requirements. Specifically, our design had to exhibit no vignetting of the combined beam at the pupil plane due to a phenomena referred to as pupil spectral shearing. That is, the system had to be impervious to laser mode hopping.\",\n",

But traditional coalition formation mechanism allows a cloud provider to participate into a single coalition which leads to under-utilize of coalition resources with increasing security risk like botnet attacks. In this paper, a mathematical framework from cooperative game namely overlapping coalition formation (OCF) game to overcome the under-utilization problem and to reduce security risk for cloud providers (CPs) is introduced by permitting a CP to participate into multiple small coalitions. First, the concepts of OCF game in cloud is presented and then, an algorithm for the stability in OCF game is introduced.

In this paper, a lock improvement technique is proposed to alleviate interrupt invocations caused by the lock acquire operations, leading to reduction in the lock acquisition time and the overall program execution time. Our improvement technique was evaluated under the TreadMarks' framework using four applications, where TreadMarks is a distributed shared memory system based on LRC.

              " 323613: \"In wireless ad hoc networks, autonomous nodes are reluctant to forward others' packets because of the nodes' limited energy. However, such selfishness and noncooperation deteriorate both the system efficiency and nodes' performances. Moreover, the distributed nodes with only local information may not know the cooperation point, even if they are willing to cooperate. Hence, it is crucial to design a distributed mechanism for enforcing and learning the cooperation among the greedy nodes in packet forwarding. In this paper, we propose a self- learning repeated-game framework to overcome the problem and achieve the design goal. We employ self-transmission efficiency as the utility function of individual autonomous node. The self transmission efficiency is defined as the ratio of the power for self packet transmission over the total power for self packet transmission and packet forwarding. Then, we propose a framework to search for good cooperation points and maintain the cooperation among selfish nodes. The framework has two steps: First, an adaptive repeated game scheme is designed to ensure the cooperation among nodes for the current cooperative packet forwarding probabilities. Second, self-learning algorithms are employed to find the better cooperation probabilities that are feasible and benefit all nodes. We propose three learning schemes for different information structures, namely, learning with perfect observability, learning through flooding, and learning through utility prediction. Starting from noncooperation, the above two steps are employed iteratively, so that better cooperating points can be achieved and maintained in each iteration. From the simulations, the proposed framework is able to enforce cooperation among distributed selfish nodes and the proposed learning schemes achieve 70% to 98% performance efficiency compared to that of the optimal solution.\",\n",

We study the susceptibility of such strategies to misbehavior by some nodes in the network; specifically, we consider a node to be malicious if it updates its value arbitrarily at each time-step, instead of following the predefined linear iterative strategy.

We consider two network architectures: local sources (LS) at each optical network unit (ONU) versus a single source located at the central office. We examine both architectures over a 20-km optical link, as well as a reference back-to-back configuration. Our architectures can adopt two-feeder and single-feeder topologies; however, we only test the two-feeder topology and therefore the effect of Rayleigh backscattering is neglected. We also study the relative merits (cost and performance) of local sources versus centralized architectures. A penalty of less than 2 dB between the LS and the centralized light sources (CLS) architectures was measured at a bit error rate (BER) of 10-9 under certain assumptions on the relative power of the sources. The power budget in the CLS architectures is more critical than in the LS architectures; extra splitting and propagation losses exist as the uplink travels through the network back and forth. Doubling the number of users while maintaining the same distance and source power in LS architectures imposes 3-dB additional losses, whereas for CLS architectures, there are 6-dB extra losses. CLS architectures can overcome these penalties using amplification at the central office. Alternately, central office amplification can be used to more than double the number of users in LS SAC-OCDMA PONs. A standalone (no global clock) burst-mode receiver with clock and data recovery (CDR), clock and phase alignment (CPA), and Reed-Solomon RS(255,239) forward-error correction (FEC) decoder is demonstrated. A penalty of less than 0.25 dB due to the nonideal sampling of the CDR is reported. The receiver also provides an instantaneous phase acquisition time for any phase step between consecutive packets, and a good immunity to silence periods. A coding gain of more than 2.5 dB was reported for a single-user system, and BER floors were completely eliminated. Error-free transmission (BER < 10-9 ) for a fully loaded PON was achieved for the LS architecture as well as the CLS architecture. Continuous and bursty upstream traffic were tested. Due to the CPA algorithm, even with zero preamble bits we report a zero packet loss ratio (PLR) for up to four simultaneous users in case of bursty traffic, and more than two orders of magnitude improvement in the PLR for fully loaded PON systems.',\n",

A dynamic performance test rig with a GFB mounted on a rotating hollow shaft, heated by a cartridge heater inside the hollow shaft, and excited by two orthogonally positioned electromagnetic shakers determines the frequency dependent stiffness and damping coefficients of the test GFB for increasing shaft temperatures. The test heater temperatures are 21°C (room temperature without heating), 100°C, 200°C, 300°C, and 400°C, and the excitation frequencies are 120 Hz, 140 Hz, 160 Hz, and 180 Hz. The test rotating speed and static load are 12 krpm and 30 N, respectively. The vibration amplitude of the test GFB is adjusted to approximately 30 μm by controlling the power amplifier connected to the electromagnetic shakers throughout the series of experiments. The test results show that both the direct stiffness and damping coefficients of the test GFB increase with increasing excitation frequencies. As the shaft temperature increases, the direct stiffness coefficients decrease by ∼ 8%, and the direct damping coefficients decrease by approximately 30%. A model prediction benchmarked against the test data reveals that the cross-coupled stiffness coefficients are smaller than the direct stiffness coefficients for the test GFB.',\n",

One reason for this is, that in comparison with software maintainability, evolvability characteristics are hardly defined. This paper discusses evolvability, and introduces a quality model for it. Furthermore, a meta-model-based process for controlling and optimising the evolvability characteristics of software baselines is presented.

If a failure occurs, it is detected using any Byzantine agreement protocol that can agree on a recent valid system's state.

In the low UHF band, such antennas will have sizes on the order of a meter. Artificial magnetic conducting (AMC) substrates have been shown to reduce the profile (height) of these antennas, but at the expense of operating bandwidth. Adding tunability has restored the flexibility of dynamically adjusting the communication channel over a wide range, but the lateral dimensions of the antenna are still quite large. Here we introduce a miniaturized low-profile antenna system based on a tunable AMC substrate beneath a tunable small antenna element.

              " 113225: 'Because of the wide use of randomized scheduling in concurrency testing research, it is important to understand randomized scheduling and its limitations. This work analyzes how randomized scheduling discovers concurrency bugs by focusing on the probabilities of the two possible orders of a pair of events. Analysis shows that the disparity between probabilities can be large for programs that encounter a large number of events during execution. Because sets of ordered event pairs define conditions for discovering concurrency bugs, this disparity can make some concurrency bugs highly unlikely. The complementary nature of the two possible orders also indicates a potential trade-off between the probability of discovering frequently-occurring and infrequently-occurring concurrency bugs. To help address this trade-off in a more balanced way, randomized-stride scheduling is proposed, where scheduling granularity for each thread is adjusted using a randomized stride calculated based on thread length. With some assumptions, strides can be calculated to allow covering the least likely event pair orders. Experiments confirm the analysis results and also suggest that randomized-stride scheduling is more effective for discovering concurrency bugs compared to the original randomized scheduling implementation, and compared to other algorithms in recent literature.',\n",

              " 572391: 'Recent information theoretic results suggest that in richly scattered wireless environments, systems with multiple transmit and multiple receive antennas (MIMO systems) can have very large capacities. In particular, Foschini and Gans [l] considered a channel with nt transmit and n, receive antennas, with Rayleigh flat faded channel gains i.i.d. across antenna pairs, and showed that at high SNR, the capacity of this channel grows like min(nt, n,) log SNR for large SNR. This yields a min{nt, n,}-fold increase in capacity over a channel with a single transmit and a single receive antenna. The parameter min{nt,n,} can be interpreted as the number of degrees of freedom (d.0.f.) of the channel: the dimension of the space over which communication can take place. The above result assumes that the receiver can perfectly track the fading gains of the channel (so-called perfect channel state information CSI at the receiver). In high mobility applications, this may not be a reasonable assumption. Moreover, in the high SNR regime where the amount of noise is small, it is conceivable that the impact of channel uncertainty on performance is more pronounced. This leads to the question: what is the high SNR capacity of time-varying fading channels without the prior assumption of CSI? Towards this end, Lapidoth and Moser [2], building on earlier work by Taricco and Elia [3], recently showed a contrasting result: that at high SNR, the fmt order term of the capacity is log log SNR, regardless of what the number of transmit and receive antennas is. Thus, not only does capacity grow much slower than in the case with perfect CSI, but this result also suggests that without CSI, the performance gain from having multiple antennas, if any, will only appear as a second-order effect. The increase in the number of the degrees of freedom has minimal impact. Does this then suggest that the perfect CSI results are very fragile? Even though [2] explicitly incorporates the channel variation (and the associated uncertainty) in its model, this result is still asymptotic in the SNR and thus one has to be care ful in interpreting its regime of validity. In particular, since the channel variation process is k e d while the SNR is taken to infinity, it is conceivable that the 1oglogSNR growth only occurs when the noise level is much smaller than the amount of channel variation from one sample to the next. However, typical wireless channels are underspread, which means that this variation is small. Thus, one has to look at the effect of the SNR and the amount of channel variation simultaneously to get a more complete picture. In this work, we would like to put forth such a picture. Suppose the fading process for each channel gain is Gauss-Markov and define SPR to be the inverse of the one-step MMSE prediction error. For underspread channels, SPR is large. We',\n",

The coordinative manipulation problem is divided into two phases. One is determining the resultant force by multiple robotic mechanisms, and the other is determining the internal force between them. The resultant force is used for the manipulation of an object subjected by the external forces or the environmental constraints. The internal force is used for adapting the robotic mechanisms to uncertainty and variety of the static friction. A dynamic coordinative control scheme is proposed for determining the resultant forces. The optimal internal force is defined as the internal force that yields the minimal norm force satisfying static frictional constraints. The optimal internal force promotes the stability of prehension, while the conventional method sometimes result in too much internal force and reduce the stability. Finally, by applying a non-linear programming method, it is clarified that the optimal solution is necessarily obtained by solving, at most, 2(2m-1) (m is the number of robotic mechanisms) sets of algebraic equations if it exists.',\n",

The mobile phones are often used in a neighbourhood of human body. It is considered that a part of the radiated electromagnetic wave by mobile phones is absorbed into the human body. In order to analyse interaction between electromagnetic wave and human body a lot of researches have been performed. The quantity of energy absorption is evaluated by using SAR. SAR can be obtained by electric field as SAR = σ E2/ρ [w/kg] (1) Where ρ is density, E is electric field (rms), σ is conductivity. There are three types of SAR measurement techniques, one of which is point SAR measurement technique. Point SAR can be measured easily by using electric field probe or temperature sensor. In the case of using temperature sensor, SAR can be estimated by SAR = c ΔT/Δt [w/kg] (2) Where c is specific heat, ΔT is temperature elevation, Δt is heating time. Another type of SAR measurement techniques is surface SAR distribution. The surface SAR distribution can be measured by using thermography camera. Last SAR measurement technique is whole body SAR. Whole body SAR is total absorption power of target as human body. In order to measure whole body SAR, some techniques have been proposed. One of techniques is using electric field probe and scanning it. This technique can apply for only liquid type target as liquid phantom because the probe cannot scan if the target is solid. Another method is measuring total radiated power (TRP). A radiated power is absorbed by the human body. Therefore a part of radiated power is disappearing due to absorption by the human body. If TRP and input power of the antenna are known then WB-SAR can be measured by comparing these powers. This techniques is well known as measurement of antenna efficiency. However, large-scale equipment is required to measure TRP as 3-dimensional field scanner. Furthermore, huge measurement time is needed due to 3-dimensinal TRP measurement. Therefore a measurement technique of WB-SAR is not established yet. On the other hand, Wheeler cap method is well known as antenna efficiency measurement technique. Reflection coefficient of the antenna and shielding cap are used to measure antenna efficiency in the Wheeler cap method. This technique does not require large-scale equipment. The authors have proposed effective whole body SAR measurement technique by using wheeler cap method for small size phantom. In this paper, the proposed method is expanded to human head size phantom.

The proposed methods have reduced computational complexity for real-time operation mode. The principle of the presented mathematical apparatus operation is to construct a virtual rectilinear energy-efficient path for moving the manipulator effector to a given position and then iteratively pushing the manipulator links out of the obstacle area to build the necessary movement route. The developed methods can be modified according to the necessary criteria of motion manipulator quality. This article presents the results of the new algorithm energy efficiency analysis that combines the previously described methods. A comparison with the selected analogue, the principle of which is based on the representation of objects in the form of oriented connected containers, is accomplished. The results of an experiments series on the simulation model implemented in MatLab show a reduction in the energy consumption of manipulators when performing targeted operations in the working area with or without an obstacle. A promising area of further research is the modification of the proposed mathematical apparatus for working in a zone with multiple stationary and dynamic obstacles, as well as the elimination of collisions when working with a human.',\n",

As the author has been considering the system many transmitters radiate signals more or less simultaneously, and each receiver must pick out of this mixture of signals those signals which are intended for him.

The agents are thought to hold uninformative probabilistic prior beliefs about an issue that concerns them and learn about this state of the world through a non-Bayesian myopic DeGroot-style update process applied on the priors using social influence 'mixtures'. We model external information sources in this framework as entities that can bring to the attention of agents 'global' beliefs that are potentially from beyond the confines of a community, and may well be in conflict among themselves. In our model agents score these information sources on the basis of how closely the beliefs propounded by the sources match their own beliefs, but determine how to assimilate such beliefs on the basis of the views of their community of connected neighbors. This form of social learning of external information allows local social influences to carry shared views resulting in the potential emergence of modified homophyllic structures, for example to capture the notion that those who view external information sources in a similar manner might be inclined to demonstrate higher affinities among themselves. We show that this form of social learning of externally expounded beliefs has a learnable dynamic which achieves convergence, and can mirror scenarios where external sources can bring about consensus among opposed cliques, or break emerging consensus. We illustrate the working of the learning model on a simple example.\",\n",

In particular, we consider the questions whether PP is as powerful as PSPACE and whether PP is more powerful than PH (the polynomial-time hierarchy). These questions have remained open. In fact, only a few results have been shown even in the relativized case. In the present paper we deal with the above questions in a manner similar to Long (1985), Balcazar (1986), and Long and Selman (1986). We introduce a quantitative restriction on access to a given oracle for probabilistic oracle machines. The restriction, denoted as PR R (·), allows polynomial time-bounded probabilistic oracle machines to query only polynomially many positive strings but exponentially many negative strings in its computation tree. We show that for every oracle A that PP R (NP)( A ) is included in PP( A ). This strengthens the result shown recently by Biegel (1989). In fact, we have their result as an immediate consequence. We next show some positive relativization results on the above questions. We show that seprating PP from PSPACE with some sparse oracle implies the separation of PP from PSPACE in the nonrelativized case. We also show that separating PP from PH with some sparse oracle implies the separation in the nonrelativized case. We also compare D # P and with PH. In particular, we show that D # P = PH iff D # ( S ) = PH ( S ) for some sparse oracle set S . Thus, the inequality D # P ≠ PH can also be relativized for all sparse oracle sets.',\n",

However, attacks have evolved to exploit weaknesses in these defenses. To thwart these attacks, we introduce a novel technique called Instruction Location Randomization (ILR). Conceptually, ILR randomizes the location of every instruction in a program, thwarting an attacker's ability to re-use program functionality (e.g., arc-injection attacks and return-oriented programming attacks). ILR operates on arbitrary executable programs, requires no compiler support, and requires no user interaction. Thus, it can be automatically applied post-deployment, allowing easy and frequent re-randomization. Our preliminary prototype, working on 32-bit x86 Linux ELF binaries, provides a high degree of entropy. Individual instructions are randomly placed within a 31-bit address space. Thus, attacks that rely on a priori knowledge of the location of code or derandomization are not feasible. We demonstrated ILR's defensive capabilities by defeating attacks against programs with vulnerabilities, including Adobe's PDF viewer, acroread, which had an in-the-wild vulnerability. Additionally, using an industry-standard CPU performance benchmark suite, we compared the run time of prototype ILR-protected executables to that of native executables.

Therefore, there is no need to divide the multivariable state space model in the synchronous d-q reference frame into inner and outer separate loops. The control design is based on Lyapunov stability criterion and the proposed control law has two parts: a switching component forcing the system's trajectory to the sliding surface and a continuous component valid on the sliding surface. The proposed control strategy allows a better stability and robustness over a wide range of operation. The variable structure controller presented is successfully demonstrated by simulation results.\",\n",

The limit to voltage scaling for deterministic computing is the thermodynamic limit where gates begin to fail on a probabilistic basis due to thermal noise. It has been shown in prior work that probabilistic datapath units can be designed to compute successfully and that this operation is desireable given the extreme energy savings available. Continuing with this work, 2 novel theorems are developed proving which gates and circuit topologies are most amenable to probabilistic errors. To illustrate these theorems at work, a case study of a full adder is given that shows the most energy efficient full adder design for a given error rate under ultra-low supply voltage conditions where the thermal noise constraint exists. Simulation results using TSMC 0.25 mum technology are given verifying the ultra-low power, probabilistic full adder designs. It will be shown that for a given error rate, the energy consumption of a full adder can be improved up to 6X over the baseline case that optimizes for speed using these probabilistic design principles. Further, over 10X energy savings is acheived for a full adder over the deterministic case.',\n",

Statistical inference on monitoring data is here helpful to reduce the overheads of application profiling and to infer missing information. While linear regression of utilization data is often used to estimate service rates, it suffers erratic performance and also ignores a large part of application monitoring data, e.g., response times. Yet inference from other metrics, such as response times or queue-length samples, is complicated by the dependence on scheduling policies. To address these issues, we propose novel scheduling-aware estimation approaches for multi-threaded applications based on linear regression and maximum likelihood estimators. The proposed methods estimate demands from samples of the number of requests in execution in the worker threads at the admission instant of a new request. Validation results are presented on simulated and real application datasets for systems with multi-class requests, class switching, and admission control.',\n",

Thus, it is important to study the performance of existing distributed database protocols in the new networking environment, identify the performance bottlenecks and develop protocols that are capable of taking advantage of the high-speed networking technology.

These optimizations, collectively called the group two-phase locking (g-2PL) protocol, reduce the number of rounds of message passing by grouping lock grants, client-end caching and data migration. In a simulation study, 20-25% improvement in the response time of the g-2PL protocol over that of the s-2PL protocol was observed.',\n",

In this paper, we propose an error-resilient architecture for Context-Adaptive Variable Length Coding (CAVLC) in H.264/AVC. Due to its context-adaptive nature and intricate control flow CAVLC is very sensitive to soft errors. An error during the CAVLC process (especially during the context adaptation or in VLC tables) may result in severe mismatch between encoder and decoder. The primary goal in our error-resilient CAVLC architecture is to protect codeword/codelength tables and context adaptation in a reliable yet power efficient manner. For reducing the power overhead, the tables are partitioned in various sub-tables each protected with variable-sized parity. Moreover, for further power reduction, our approach incorporates state-retentive power-gating of different sub-tables at run time depending upon the statistical distribution of syntax elements. Compared to the unprotected case, our scheme provides a video quality improvement of 18dB (averaged over various fault injection cases and video sequences) at the cost of a 35% area overhead and 45% performance overhead due to the error-detection logic. However, partitioned sub-tables increase the potential for power-gating, thus bring a leakage energy saving of 58%. Compared to state-of-the-art table protection, our scheme provides 2x reduced area and performance overhead. For functional verification and area comparison, the architecture is prototyped on a Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA, though not limited to it.

Such statements correspond to weight constraints, and thus impact on which project portfolios are potentially optimal or non-dominated in view of the resulting set of feasible attribute weights. In this paper, we extend earlier preference elicitation approaches by allowing the decision maker to make direct statements about the selection and rejection of individual projects. We convert such project preference statements to weight information by determining the weights for which (i) the selected project is included in all potentially optimal or non-dominated portfolios, or (ii) the rejected project is not included in any potentially optimal or non-dominated portfolio. We prove that the two complementary selection rules will exclude exactly the same set of weights. However, analyses that apply the dominance structure often lead to multiple, mutually exclusive feasible weight sets, and therefore the approach based on potential optimality is more relevant for practical decision analysis. We also propose ex ante value of information measures to guide the elicitation of project preference statements, and illustrate our results by analyzing a real case on the selection of infrastructure maintenance projects.',\n",

This paper will discuss the energy efficiency of MIMO systems with antenna selection. The optimal method for the maximization of energy efficiency is exhaustive search. To address the problem, an iterative algorithm which includes the transmit antenna selection and power adaptation is proposed. It is based on the iterative property of the energy efficiency, which is derived in this paper. This property guides us to select the antenna that achieves the largest energy efficiency increment at each step. There is also a power adaptation for each step where we calculate the optimal transmission power and then set it as the initial one for the next step. Moreover, one asymptotic property exists in the proposed algorithm, which states that the antenna selection and power adaptation can be decoupled in high and low SNR regimes. This fact reduces the complexity further and enables us to achieve the optimal performance with a greater probability. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves near-optimal performance in all the SNR regimes and has a remarkable gain over the no selection scheme in the energy efficiency and transmission power.',\n",

The proposed policy iteration method relies on: a policy evaluation step with a piecewise quadratic Lyapunov function in both the state and the deadzone functions of the input signals; a policy improvement step which guarantees at the same time close to optimality (exploitation) and persistence of excitation (exploration). The proposed approach guarantees convergence of the trajectory to a neighborhood around the origin. Besides, the trajectories can be made arbitrarily close to the optimal one provided that the rate at which the the value function and the control policy are updated is fast enough. The solution to the inequalities required to hold at each policy evaluation step can be efficiently implemented with semidefinite programming (SDP) solvers.

A novel cooperative NOMA scheme is proposed, where a strong user with better channel conditions adopts power splitting (PS) scheme and acts as an energy-harvesting relay to forward the decoded signal to the weak user. The presence of channel uncertainties is considered by introducing the outage-based constraints of signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR). Specifically, it is assumed that only imperfect channel state information (CSI) is known at the base station (BS), due to the reason that the BS is far away from both users and suffers serious feedback delay. Our aim is to maximize the strong user's data rate, by optimally designing the robust transmit beamforming and PS ratio, while guaranteeing the correct decoding of the weak user.

She assigns each task to a set of workers over the Internet, instead of computing the task locally. For each task each worker reply to the master with the task result. Since the task was not computed locally, the master can not trust the result for two main reasons: (i) workers might deliberately provide an incorrect result, (ii) the result is corrupted due to some hardware or software failure during the execution of the task. Given the above, we can model our workers as either “altruistic”, always willing to provide the correct result to each task, or “troll” that are trying to provide an incorrect result to each task. Moreover we model the failure of the worker to comply with her intended behavior, as an error probability ε. The goal of the master is to compute the correct result of all the tasks with high probability. In the literature two techniques have been used to achieve this goal: (i) “voting”, that determines the correct result of a task given multiple replies of distinct workers; (ii) “challenges”, that are tasks whose result is known and can be used to detect altruistic workers. What separates our work from the current literature is the realistic modelling of the worker's behavior and the fact that we do not restrict the task result to a binary set of answers; the domain of possible replies for a task can have multiple correct and multiple incorrect results. Given the above we evaluate the performance of the two techniques described in the literature in the scenario where ε = 0 and when ε > 0. Performance is measured in terms of: (1) time, i.e., the number of rounds performed by an algorithm for the computation of all the tasks, and (2) work, i.e., the number of total task computations performed by the workers. The case where ε = 0 is used as a best case scenario that provides the optimal time and work bounds of the problem. In the case where ε > 0 we propose two “natural” algorithms: one using a combination of both voting and challenges, and a second one using only voting.

With the development of high-density, flip chip packages, an underfill process for fine-pitch bump size become more important. WLUF (wafer level underfill) is a technology that applies an underfill material onto a wafer front side and encapsulates the flip chip package without the need for capillarity flow and flux dispensing. Thus, voids from capillarity flow may be avoided and flux-dispensing process is eliminated to prevent potential reliability risks resulting from residual fluxes. In this study, we describe the investigation of a new WLUF technology for fine pitch WLCSP packages and present the lamination and bonding test results using the WLUF materials on our test WLCSP packages.',\n",

Most well-established enhancement techniques with conventional arrays can be adapted into ad hoc scenarios. Despite recent efforts to introduce various ad hoc speech enhancement apparatus, a common framework for integration of conventional methods into this new scheme is still missing. This paper establishes such an abstraction based on inter and intra subarray speech coherencies. Along with measures for signal quality at the input of subarrays, a measure of coherency is proposed both for subarray selection in local enhancement approaches, and also for selecting a proper global reference when more than one subarray are used. Proposed methods within this framework are evaluated with regard to quantitative and qualitative measures, including array gains, the speech distortion ratio, the PESQ measure, and the STOI intelligibility measure. Major findings in this work are the observed changes in the superiority of different methods for certain conditions. When perceptual quality or intelligibility of the speech are the ultimate goals, there are turning points where the MVDR and the LCMV are superior to Wiener-based methods. Also, for certain scenarios, local approaches may be preferred to global ones.',\n",

This map demonstrates the relationship between all the candidates and the templates, and it is constructed based on the solution to an innovative optimization formulation named multitask reverse sparse representation formulation, which searches multiple subsets from the whole candidate set to simultaneously reconstruct multiple templates with minimum error. A customized APG method is derived for getting the optimum solution (in matrix form) within several iterations. This formulation allows the candidates to be evaluated accurately in parallel rather than one-by-one like most sparsity-based trackers do and meanwhile considers the relationship between candidates, therefore it is more superior in terms of cost-performance ratio. The discriminative information containing in this map comes from a large template set with multiple positive target templates and hundreds of negative templates. A Laplacian term is introduced to keep the coefficients similarity level in accordance with the candidates similarities, thereby making our tracker more robust. A pooling approach is proposed to extract the discriminative information in the DSS map for easily yet effectively selecting good candidates from bad ones and finally get the optimum tracking results. Plenty experimental evaluations on challenging image sequences demonstrate that the proposed tracking algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods.',\n",

New disciplines have emerged as natural language processing that involve identifying all aspects of language (spoken or written). In this perspective, we focus on the aspect of part-of speech (POS) tagging applied to the Arabic language which consists in marking each word in the text with its good tag. One of the most difficult problems affecting POS tagging is the ambiguity of the text. Ambiguity is the most important problem in the natural language processing. We propose a rule-based hybrid approach with an artificial neural network classifier to determine the appropriate tags of an Arabic text. The first phase consists of extracting all the affixes to identify the nature of the word and its tags according to grammatical rules, the second phase begins by transliterating the Arabic text into text with Roman letters. The transliterated text is then transformed into digital vectors to form the input of the classifier based on the neural networks. The two phases are combined to identify the tag of each word.',\n",

To improve the coding efficiency of intra coding, HEVC employs a flexible quad-tree coding block partitioning structure and 35 intra prediction modes. The optimal prediction mode is selected through rough mode decision (RMD) and rate distortion optimisation (RDO) process. Due to the huge search space of all of the possible depth levels (CU sizes) and intra prediction modes, intra coding of HEVC is a very time-consuming and complicated process, which limits the application of HEVC. In order to reduce the intra coding complexity, we propose a fast mode decision algorithm for HEVC intra prediction which is based on dominant edge assent (DEA) and its distribution. The four DEAs in the directions of degree 0, 45, 90 and 135 are computed first; then, the dominant edge is decided according to the minimum DEA. Next, a subset of prediction modes in accordance with the dominant edge is chosen for the RMD process. The rule is as follows: When the standard deviation of DEA is distinctly small, we skip the RMD process and take the direct current (DC) mode and planar modes as the candidate modes for the RDO process; when the minimum DEA is distinctly small, we select seven modes as the candidate modes for the RMD process; otherwise, we select 11 modes for the RMD process.

The speed of the system is improved by the appropriate combination of the detection and tracking algorithms. Further, instead of the whole face, histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) features are extracted from the active facial patches which makes the system robust against the scale and pose variations. The feature vectors are further fed to a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to classify into neutral or six universal expressions.

Individual sensor nodes within a network are typically resource-constrained, event-driven, and require a high degree of concurrency. This combination of requirements motivated the development of the widely used TinyOS sensor node operating system. The TinyOS concurrency model is a lightweight nonpreemptive system designed to suit the needs of typical sensor network applications. Although the TinyOS concurrency model is easier to reason about than preemptive threads, it can still give rise to undesirable behavior due to unexpected interleavings of related tasks, or unanticipated preemption by interrupt handlers. To aid TinyOS developers in understanding the behavior of their programs we have developed a technique for using the process algebra Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) to model the interactions between TinyOS components, and between an application and the TinyOS scheduling and preemption mechanisms. Analysis of the resulting models can help TinyOS developers to discover and diagnose concurrency-related errors in their designs that might otherwise go undetected until after the application has been widely deployed. Such analysis is particularly valuable for the TinyOS components that are used as building blocks for a large number of other applications, since a subtle or sporadic error in a widely deployed building block component could be extremely costly to repair.',\n",

An OFDM signal with high PAPR requires power amplifier@?s (PAs) with large linear operating ranges but such PAs are difficult to design and costly to manufacture. Therefore, to reduce PAPR various methods have been proposed. One of the existing technique to reduce PAPR is partial transmit sequences (PTS). The major drawback of this technique is that it requires transmission of side information (SI) with each OFDM symbol, which results in low bandwidth efficiency. It is hard to recover the side information from the OFDM signal received at the receiver. The two methods, which do not require SI to decode the OFDM symbol at the receiver, are multi-point square mapping combined with PTS (M-PTS) and concentric circle mapping based PTS (CCM-PTS). In this paper, the SER performance of PTS based methods namely CCM-PTS and M-PTS over AWGN channel is mathematically analyzed. The SER performance of CCM-PTS over AWGN is analyzed using two decoding techniques, namely minimum distance decoding and circular boundary decoding, whereas M-PTS is analyzed using minimum distance decoding. The simulation results for SER performance of CCM-PTS and M-PTS, over fading channel, have been presented using computer simulations and the SER performance of CCM-PTS by both the decoding techniques is compared with M-PTS.

The tail of the simplified frames is then applied in the second unfolding, which starts from the initial state and checks the properties. We use a circuit graph representation for all functions and perform simplification by merging vertices that are functionally equivalent under given input constraints. In the noninitialized unfolding, previous time frames progressively tighten these constraints thus leading to an asymptotic simplification of the transition relation. As a side benefit, our method can find inductive invariants constructively by detecting when vertices are functionally equivalent across time frames. This information is then used to further simplify the transition relation and, in some cases, prove unbounded correctness of properties.

              " 258846: \"A mixed-methods study of academic performance and Facebook among U.S.-based college students.A qualitative account of how a U.S.-sample of college students conferred meanings to their academic lives on Facebook.Academic performance may determine college students' Facebook use, rather than the reverse.Those with lower GPAs may disclose negative affective states in their academic disclosure on Facebook. This paper uses a mixed-methods approach to examine the relation between online academic disclosure and academic performance. A multi-ethnic sample of college students (N=261; male=66; female=195; M age ź 22years) responded to open-ended questions about their Facebook use. Thematic analysis revealed that over 14% of the Facebook wall posts/status updates (N=714) contained academic themes; positive states were more frequent than negative and neutral states and students with lower GPAs expressed negative states more often. A path analysis suggested that academic performance may determine college students' Facebook use, rather than the reverse. Implications for student support services are discussed.\",\n",

The PEBB is an H-bridge converter module that can be cascaded to construct multilevel converters. Novel designs including gate driver with Rogowski shortcircuit protection, powerful distributed controller, isolated A/D sensor with high common-mode noise rejection, double-side cooling mechanical layout have been achieved. The paper begin with the evolution of PEBB architectures and the specifications of the designed PEBB. It then presents detailed design considerations and solutions of all the critical components.

              " 181434: 'Fast frequency hopped spread-spectrum is used in military satellite communication systems for providing resilience to different types of jamming. Most analyses focus either on the worst case jamming to obtain performance metrics such as Bit Error Rate (BER), or use specific waveforms and evaluate system performance by means of simulations. Recently there has been a growing interest in using Adaptive Coding and Modulation (ACM) and tune the modulation and coding to specific jamming scenarios, in order to maximize system throughput. This paper provides information theoretic bounds for such systems with wide-band and pulse jammers. Developing these bounds also provide insight into how to construct waveforms which maximize system capacity, while providing the desired jamming resistance. Since fast frequency hopped spread-spectrum systems also typically use Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), there is synchronization overhead. So, information theoretic bounds for capacity, where the transmitter and receiver are not perfectly carrier phase synchronized are also developed. These bounds will prove useful in determining the \"best\" system capacity, which can then be compared with the actual throughput achieved by a specific waveform.',\n",

Sequential forward selection (SFS) technique for multistage emotion classification scheme is proposed in this paper. Feature sets were formed from initial collection of 6552 speech emotion features. Experimental study was performed using Berlin emotional speech and Lithuanian spoken language emotions databases. The proposed multistage classification scheme was compared with single stage scheme. Multistage scheme determined higher order of feature sets and demonstrated higher classification accuracy than single stage scheme by 0.5-4.3 %. The superiority of SFS technique against maximal individual efficiency and minimal cross-correlation selection criterions in multistage classification scheme was 20 % approximately.',\n",
              " 47417: 'It is possible to foresee the day when prefabricated, programmable devices such as Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are used as the dominant silicon implementation medium. This paper will explore the forces that already drive in that direction and the architecture, CAD and circuit enhancement opportunities that may also help to make it happen. We will focus on the central question in FPGA architecture: what hard, dedicated circuit structures should be included on the FPGA? These structures are contrasted with the regular soft fabric, which can always be used to implement logic functions, but with less efficiency and performance. We will discuss the trade-offs involved, and the requirements for CAD tools and algorithms needed to support these hard structures. An interesting specific case that will be addressed is whether processors should be implemented in hard or soft form. Finally we will look an alternative: enhancing the capability of the soft fabric itself.',\n",
              " 1091886: 'High-power laser plays an important role in many fields, such as directed energy weapon, optoelectronic contermeasures, inertial confinement fusion, industrial processing and scientific research. The uniform nearfield and wavefront are the important part of the beam quality for high power lasers, which is conducive to maintaining the high spatial beam quality in propagation. We demonstrate experimentally that the spatial intensity and wavefront distribution at the output is well compensated in the complex high-power solid-state laser system by using the small-aperture spatial light modulator (SLM) and deformable mirror (DM) in the front stage. The experimental setup is a hundred-Joule-level Nd:glass laser system operating at three wavelengths at 1053 nm (1ω), 527 nm (2ω) and 351 nm (3ω) with 3 ns pulse duration with the final output beam aperture of 60 mm. While the clear arperture of the electrically addressable SLM is less than 20 mm and the effective diameter of the 52-actuators DM is about 15 mm. In the beam shaping system, the key point is that the two front-stage beam shaping devices needs to precompensate the gain nonuniform and wavefront distortion of the laser system. The details of the iterative algorithm for improving the beam quality are presented. Experimental results show that output nearfield and wavefont are both nearly flat-topped with the nearfield modulation of 1.26:1 and wavefront peak-to-valley value of 0.29 λ at 1053nm after beam shaping.',\n",
