              " 350063: 'The recently developed IEEE 802.11ad (WiGig) standard offers multi-Gbps connectivity for consumer wireless local area networks and operates in the millimeter wave frequency band (around 60 GHz). It supports two different contention-based channel access mechanisms, namely distributed coordination function, which offers fair service for every station, and the enhanced distributed channel Access (EDCA) for offering service differentiation among the stations. In this paper, we study the throughput performance of the IEEE 802.11ad EDCA mechanism under saturated traffic conditions using both analytical and simulation models. A novel five-dimensional Markov chain developed is used for analytically modeling the throughput behavior of the IEEE 802.11ad EDCA in the presence of virtual antenna sectors, high-gain directional beamforming, and presence of contention and contention-free access periods. Using this developed analytical model, the effect of the number of sectors, number of stations, arbitration inter-frame space, packet length, and minimum contention window size on the throughput of the four different access or service categories present in the EDCA under saturated traffic conditions, is investigated. When compared with the simulation outcomes, the proposed analytical model accurately analyzes the network performance by achieving less than 4% error.',\n",

A major challenge in this problem is overcoming errors and imprecision in locating the unknown position of a randomly deployed sensor. Localization is also an initial step to subsequent procedures such as routing and information exchange. Thus, if the result from localization is inaccurate, then future processes would be tainted with error. We propose a new approach for cooperative object localization by a group of communicating sensors. Information gathered by these sensors is combined using fuzzy logic techniques to attain a sensor positioning algorithm with minimized error.',\n",

The final decision is made by a fuzzy expert system, which improves the accuracy rate provided by a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) classifier taking into account the audio labels assigned by the GMM classifier to past audio frames. Comparison between WLPC-SC and most timbral features proposed in [8] is performed, aiming to assess the good discriminatory power of the proposed feature. The accuracy rate improvement due to the fuzzy expert system is also reported. Experimental results reveal that our speech/music discriminator is robust and fast, making it suitable for intelligent audio coding.',\n",
              " 418364: 'Considering the widespread use of effective capacity in cross-layer design and the extensive existence of renewal service processes in communication networks, this paper thoroughly investigates the effective capacity for renewal processes. Exact expressions of the effective capacity at a given quality of service (QoS) exponent are derived for the renewal processes with either constant or variable reward. The simple expressions reveal meaningful insights, such as the monotonicity and bounds of the effective capacity. The analytical results are then applied to evaluate the cross-layer throughput for diverse hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) systems, including fixed-rate HARQ (FR-HARQ, e.g., Type I HARQ, HARQ with chase combining (HARQ-CC) and HARQ with incremental redundancy (HARQ-IR)), variable-rate HARQ (VR-HARQ), and cross-packet HARQ (XP-HARQ). Furthermore, aiming at maximizing the effective capacity via the optimal rate selection, it is disclosed that the VR-HARQ and XP-HARQ attain almost the same performance, and both of them perform better than FR-HARQ. In contrast, most of the prior outcomes approximate the effective capacity with the lack of insightful discussions that hampers the optimal design of HARQ systems. Finally, the numerical results corroborate the analytical ones.',\n",
              " 531667: 'To integrate data on the Internet, we often have to deal with uncertainties when matching data schemas from different sources. The paper proposes an approach called Mashroom+ to support human-machine interactive data mashup, which can better handle uncertainties during the semantic matching process. To improve the correctness of matching results, an interactive matching algorithm is proposed to synthesize the matching results from multiple automatic matchers based on user feedbacks. Meanwhile, to avoid bringing too much burden on users, we utilize the entropy in information theory to measure and quantify the ambiguities of different matchers and calculate the best times for users to participate. An interactive integration environment is developed based on our approach with operator recommendation capability to support on-demand data integration. Experiments show that Mashroom+ approach can achieve good balance between high correctness of matching results and low user burden with real data.',\n",

              " 506588: 'In recent years the attack vectors in the network world have increased many fold with the increased usage of Internet and with the exponential growth of various applications. Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is one of the most sought after system by security experts in safeguarding the network from both external and internal attacks. NIDS works mainly in two modes: Online and Offline. Online or real-time NIDS, such as Snort, Bro, etc., examines the packet structure to find intrusions, if any, and alerts the administrator. On the other hand, offline NIDS logs the packets flowing to and from the network, constructs features based on connections, and creates a dataset. Such NIDS datasets are used in research purposes for applying data mining, machine learning, evolutionary algorithms, etc., to detect attacks. KDD CUP 99 is one such widely used popular IDS dataset. KDD CUP 99 dataset is obsolete because many of the attacks performed to create the dataset do not exist now. Moreover, the features constructed do not pertain to network activities. It is a mixture of host based as well as network based features. So, the need for a new dataset, conforming to the present network activities and attack vectors, is inevitable. This motivated us to come out with a NIDS dataset, SSENet-2011 dataset, in this paper. SSENet-2011 dataset was constructed using Tstat tool. A real time experiment was performed, the network packets were captured, features were constructed, and the dataset was created. The created SSENet-2011 dataset was compared with the KDD CUP 99 dataset. From the experiments it is evident that a closed and secluded network such as SSENet and Tstat tool help researchers in developing and analyzing a new dataset which reflects the changing scenario of network activities.',\n",

              " 395583: \"In multi-tenant shared clouds, applications of different tenants compete for the shared network and thus suffer significant unpredictability of performance. The progress is an essential metric to measure the overall data transfer rate of a tenant and to indicate how fast a tenant can complete data transfer. Most previous work of network allocation or schedule focus on achieving the tradeoff among the fairness, performance, and efficiency. They, however, often do not make each tenant achieve noticeable progress. In this paper, we motivate to maximize tenant's progress by using information about the underlying network and traffic patterns of tenants' applications. To illustrate the feasibility of maximizing progress, we develop a network sharing framework for multi-tenant datacenter, by exploiting the benefits of careful placement of tenant's applications. Furthermore, the tenants' progress and network utilization would be further improved without impacting performance isolation, if the bandwidth demand of each application can be rescheduled. Our evaluation results show that our method provides higher tenant progress and better tenant-level performance than HUG.\",\n",
              " 961355: 'We tackle the problem of finding association rules for quantitative data. Whereas most of the previous approaches operate on hyper rectangles, we propose a representation based on half-spaces. Consequently, the left-hand side and right-hand side of an association rule does not contain a conjunction of items or intervals, but a weighted sum of variables tested against a threshold. Since the downward closure property does not hold for such rules, we propose an optimization setting for finding locally optimal rules. A simple gradient descent algorithm optimizes a parameterized score function, where iterations optimizing the first separating hyperplane alternate with iterations optimizing the second. Experiments with two real-world data sets show that the approach finds non-random patterns and scales up well. We therefore propose quantitative association rules based on half-spaces as an interesting new class of patterns with a high potential for applications.',\n",
              " 339728: 'Vibrational control algorithms have been shown their potential in achieving stability and improving the performance of engineering systems by injecting high-frequency dither signals. This paper presents the robustness analysis of nonlinear vibrational control systems while disturbances exist. The linearization matrix of the averaged system is assumed to be Hurwitz such that the nonlinear vibrational control system is vibrationally stabilizable without disturbances. In the presence of disturbances, the domain of attraction can be estimated by constructing a quadratic Lyapunov function, which provides an upper bound of disturbances that the system can handle. For all initial points from the domain of attraction, all disturbances constrained within the estimated bound, a Lyapunov-based sampling method is applied to show that the solutions converge to an ultimate bound, which is a function of the bound of disturbances. That indicates the stabilized vibrational control systems are robust to a class of additive and bounded disturbances. As an illustrative example, an inverted pendulum stabilized by the vibrational control algorithm is shown to have the ability to track a vertically moving target without a feedback, in which moving speed is regarded as a disturbance. Numerical results support the theoretic findings.',\n",

              " 1066226: \"Software-splitting is a technique for protecting software from piracy by removing code fragments from an application and placing them on a remote trusted server. The server provides the missing functionality but never the missing code. As long as the missing functionality is hard to reverse-engineer, the application cannot run without validating itself to the server. Current software-splitting techniques scale poorly to the Internet because interactions with the remote server are synchronous: the application must frequently block waiting for a response from the server. Perceptible delays due to network latency are unacceptable for many kinds of highly-reactive applications, such as games or graphics applications. This paper introduces virtual leashing, the first non-blocking software-splitting technique. Virtual leashing ensures that the application and the server communicate asynchronously, so the application's performance is independent (within reason) of large or variable network latencies. Experiments show that virtual leashing makes only modest demands on communication bandwidth, space, and computation\",\n",

While they make excellent memory devices, recently they have also been used to accomplish logic functions. The properties of MTJs are greatly different from those of electronic devices like CMOS semiconductors. This makes it challenging to design circuits that can efficiently leverage the spintronic capabilities. The current approaches to achieving logic functionality with MTJs include designing an integrated CMOS and MTJ circuit, where CMOS devices are used for implementing the required intermediate read and write circuitry. The problem with this approach is that such intermediate circuitry adds overheads of area, delay and power consumption to the logic circuit. In this paper, we present a circuit to accomplish logic operations using MTJs on data that is stored in other MTJs, without an intermediate electronic circuitry. This thus reduces the performance overheads of the spintronic circuit while also simplifying fabrication. With this circuit, we discuss the notion of performing logic operations with a non-volatile memory device and compare it with the traditional method of computation with separate logic and memory units. We find that the MTJ-based logic unit has the potential to offer a higher energy-delay efficiency than that of a CMOS-based logic operation on data stored in a separate memory module.',\n",

While the existing traffic-aware systems independently compute the fastest route based on the current and/or historical traffic condition, they ignore the fact that the uncoordinated decision based on the identical traffic view could lead to new congestion in the future. We propose a novel online route planning system called Predictive Traffic Assignment or PTA that exploits previous planned routes to accurately predict their impact on future traffic.

Most of this topic's research focuses on autonomous CWSs, where each vehicle detects potential collisions based entirely on the information measured by itself. Recently, an alternative scenario has arisen. This scenario is known as cooperative driving, where either the vehicle or the infrastructure can communicate its location, intention, or other information to surrounding vehicles or nearby infrastructure. Since installing a low-cost global-positioning-system (GPS) unit is becoming a common practice in vehicle applications, its implications in cooperative driving and vehicle safety deserve closer investigation. Furthermore, the future trajectory prediction may lead to a straightforward approach to detect potential collisions, yet its effectiveness has not been studied. This paper explores the engineering feasibility of a future-trajectory-prediction-based cooperative CWS when vehicles are equipped with a relatively simple differential GPS unit and relatively basic motion sensors. The goals of this paper are twofold: providing an engineering argument of possible functional architectures of such systems and presenting a plausible example of the proposed future-trajectory-based design, which estimates and communicates vehicle positions and predicts and processes future trajectories for collision decision making. In this paper, common GPS problems such as blockage and multipath, as well as common communication problems such as dropout and delays, are assumed.

The experimental evaluation of the proposed approach results into better exploitation of functional units, memory hierarchy and highway usage of the target processor. The advantages of the proposed interactive code transformation approach are two-folds. First, effort in optimization is spent only when the program measurement (transformation cost) determines that the effort is necessary and potentially beneficial, and only on those portions of the program where the energy/cycle performance payoff appears to be high. Second, by concatenating subsequent energy/cycle profile-driven low level transformations for higher level manipulations, the system provides the programmer with a powerful toolset.

Some examples of what can be achieved with the incorporation of electronic power converters in the system are the penetration of RS (renewable sources) and storage, boosting reliability and power quality, and integrating consumers as part of the system. However, there are still some challenges ahead before the massive deployment of Smart Grids. Lately, a lot of research has been carried out on converters topologies and control strategies in order to get the most out of the microgrids. Therefore, there is a need for methodologies that allow designers to foresee the behavior of these systems comprised of several different power converters governed by the proposed control strategies. In this context, this paper studies the performance of the polytopic models for the analysis of commercial power converters working in dc microgrids. This is a nonlinear modeling technique which integrates small-signal models obtained in different operation points by means of suitable weighting functions. Furthermore, the linear local models can be obtained in a blackbox fashion using suitable two-port models as can be the G-parameters models. This work particularly focuses on the analysis of different power converters using the well-known dc bus signaling control strategy. Thus the modeling of the diverse possible states in which this control technique can operate, and more important the transitions among them, are investigated. In addition, the feasibility of applying system level control techniques to the polytopic models of the converters, such as current sharing or voltage restoration, is considered.',\n",

Our previous work shows that the optimal solutions have common characteristic (Incremental Minimality) which makes it reasonable to design an incremental algorithm to find the minimum power broadcast trees. In this work, we identify one more characteristic (Virtual Center) which complements the incremental minimality. The optimal solutions tend to have a major subtree which can be obtained by an incremental method starting from a center node which may not be the source node of the broadcast. Our finding is about the center node (called as virtual center) and the major subtree (called as virtually centered subtree) rooted at the virtual center. We propose a new algorithm which is based on the concept of virtual center by dynamically changing the center to find the best candidate for the virtual center. The proposed algorithm effectively utilizes the Virtual Center characteristic and the empirical computation results support the validity of the characteristic by superior performance compared to algorithms in literature.',\n",

It is beneficial to exploit multiple levels of parallelism for a wide range of applications, because a typical server already has tens of processor cores now. As the number of cores in a computer is increasing rapidly, efficient support of nested parallelism will be more important. However, compared to single-level parallelism, nested-parallelism is much more complicated for programming since its configuration space of degree of parallelism is more complicated. Nowadays parallel programming models such as OpenMP only have naive support for nested parallelism, and programmers need to specify number of threads for each parallel task explicitly to get a reasonable performance. Such method has two drawbacks. First, it is a complicated job to write code to figure out appropriate configurations for different environments and contexts. Second, the runtime system lacks sufficient global information about threads allocation to make optimal decision on task-core mapping, which easily causes significant performance loss. To deal with such problems, we propose NestedMP, a set of directives which extends OpenMP. NestedMP adopts a model that propagate available threads on task tree in a top-down way, which provides global information about threads allocation for runtime system when high level parallel tasks are launched, to help it make locality-aware task-core mapping decisions. On the other side, instead of configuring number of threads explicitly, programmers control that by policies defined in NestedMP. We have written a few benchmarks by NestedMP, which shows NestedMP makes the code more concise on most cases. We have implemented NestedMP in GCC 4.8.2 and tested the performance of these benchmarks on a 4-way 8-core SandyBridge server. The result shows NestedMP improves the performance significantly over GCC's OpenMP implementation.\",\n",

To enable H.264 video encoding for digital TV broadcast and maximize its broadcast efficiency, there are two important issues that need to be adequately addressed. First, we need to understand the complex coding mechanism of an H.264 video encoder and develop a model to analyze and control its rate-distortion (R-D) behavior in an accurate and robust manner. Second, the R-D behaviors of individual channels in the broadcast system should be jointly controlled and optimized under bandwidth and buffer constraints so as to maximize the overall broadcast quality. In this paper, we develop a linear rate model and a linear rate control scheme for H.264 video coding. We develop an optimum statistical multiplexing system to allocate bits across video programs (each being encoded by an H.264 encoder) and video frames so that the overall video broadcast quality is maximized. We study the bandwidth and buffer constraints in video broadcast and formulate the optimum statistical multiplexing into a constrained mathematical optimization problem. Realizing that it is impossible to find a close-form solution for global optima, we propose a simple yet efficient algorithm to find a near-optimum solution for joint rate allocation under buffer constraints. Our extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed statistical multiplexing system achieves about 40-50% saving in bandwidth, provides a smooth video quality change across programs and frames, and maintains robust decoder buffer control.',\n",

Building upon opportunistic routing and random linear network coding, CodePipe can not only eliminate coordination between nodes, but also improve the multicast throughput significantly by exploiting both intra-batch and inter-batch coding opportunities. In particular, four key techniques, namely, LP-based opportunistic routing structure, opportunistic feeding, fast batch moving and inter-batch coding, are proposed to offer significant improvement in throughput, energy-efficiency and fairness. Moreover, we design an efficient online extension of CodePipe such that it can work in a dynamic network where nodes join and leave the network as time progresses.

In particular, it is shown that the demodulation of the substrate interference in a MOS differential input stage depends on the asymmetry of the circuits connected to the input terminals.

These mix nets have been used in several implementations of prominent e-voting systems to provide vote privacy and verifiability. In RPC mix nets, higher efficiency is traded for a lower level of privacy and verifiability. However, these mix nets have never undergone a rigorous formal analysis. Recently, Kahazei and Wikstroem even pointed out several severe problems in the original proposal and in implementations of RPC mix nets in e-voting systems, both for so-called re-encryption and Chaumian RPC mix nets. While Kahazei and Wikstroem proposed several fixes, the security status of Chaumian RPC mix nets (with the fixes applied) has been left open, re-encryption RPC mix nets, as they suggest, should not be used at all. In this paper, we provide the first formal security analysis of Chaumian RPC mix nets. We propose security definitions that allow one to measure the level of privacy and verifiability RPC mix nets offer, and then based on these definitions, carry out a rigorous analysis. Altogether, our results show that these mix nets provide a reasonable level of privacy and verifiability, and that they are still an interesting option for the use in e-voting systems.',\n",

To realize such laser systems, various aspects have to be taken into account that include beam combination elements, stabilization systems, and the output parameters of the individual amplifiers. After an introduction to the topic, various ways of implementing coherent beam combination for ultrashort pulses are explored. Besides the spatial combination of beams, the combination of pulses in time will also be discussed.

For magnetometers with a directly coupled pickup-loop three junction SQUIDs show no advantage compared to standard two junction SQUIDs, but the series connection of two ordinary dc SQUIDs does. Although for magnetometers with inductively coupled pickup-loop twenty SQUIDs in series were used the effect on the flux-to-voltage transfer coefficient was poor, due to differences in the critical current and inductance of individual SQUIDs. The sensitivity of the whole magnetometer achieved with inductively coupled single layer pickup-loops is much smaller than with directly coupled ones. For the latter a pickup-loop formed as a conventional square washer shows better results compared to a slotted square.',\n",

Here we propose a substantially different approach to design TMO, where instead of using any pre-defined systematic computational structure (such as image transformation or contrast/edge enhancement) for tone mapping, we navigate in the space of all images, searching for the image that optimizes TMQI. The navigation involves an iterative process that alternately improves the structural fidelity and statistical naturalness of the resulting image, which are the two fundamental building blocks in TMQI.

However, very few previous works in the literature put their focus on predicting personality from Chinese texts. As Chinese texts are much more difficult to delimit than English texts, it poses more challenges in recognizing personality from Chinese texts. In this paper, we attempt to classify the personality traits from Chinese texts.

Then, we used Jieba, a Chinese text segmentation tool, as the tokenizer for the task of text segmentation, and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) as the learning algorithm for personality classification. Our experimental results show that the performance in precision and recall can be significantly improved with the help of text segmentation. Moreover, exploiting side information, such as the number of friends, could improve the performance further. One interesting finding from our experiments is that extraverts seem to write more sentences and use more common words than introverts. This indicates that extraverts are more willing to share their mood and life with others than introverts.\",\n",

A warning system evaluates a driver's risk and gives an alert when the risk exceeds a threshold, where the risk criterion employed is crucial. Our previous studies have shown the effectiveness of the 2nd-order time-to-collision (TTC) that assumes a constant acceleration motion for vehicles and calculate the time until a collision. However, the criterion considers such a case to be safe that a driver follows the preceding vehicle at a constant distance, no matter how small it is. Obviously, this does not agree to a driver's feeling of risks. To take this issue into account, we make an assumption that a driver always expects the preceding vehicle's sudden brake and propose the brake-assumed 2nd-order TTC, which is the 2nd-order TTC when the preceding vehicle decelerates with fixed brake strength. This idea is simple but difficult to determine the parameters, especially the brake strength. We propose two methods for estimating a driver's imaginary deceleration. One is called the CV minimizer and the other is called the transferred deceleration. In order to confirm the effectiveness of the methods, we apply the methods to the driving data collected originally under unconstrained conditions.

              " 398945: \"Rectification of the electromyographic (EMG) signal is a commonly used pre-processing procedure that allows detection of significant coherence between EMG and measured cortical signals. It has been demonstrated that rectification enhances mean group firing rates. This paper develops an efficient algorithm that may be used to extract these relevant frequencies. This method assumes the EMG to be a realization of a randomly distributed stationary process. Therefore the 'true' power spectrum of this process will not contain specific timing information. However the power spectrum of the actual rectified EMG does contain timing information which is detectable at frequencies where it exceeds the analytic power spectrum. Coherence of measured electroencephalographic (EEG) signals and rectified EMG show that significant coherence peaks occur at the same frequencies obtained using the algorithm. Cortical drive appears to synchronize motor unit firings to particular frequencies that may be extracted from the rectified EMG alone. These frequencies are not easily obtained from either the EEG or the non-rectified EMG.\",\n",

Bayesian theory is used as a tool to model a belief network to configure semantic labels for image regions. These semantic labels for regions are obtained from a multi visual feature-based object detection approach. The aim is to model potential semantic descriptions of basic objects in the images, the dependencies between them, and the conditional probabilities involved in those dependencies. This information is then used to calculate the probabilities of the effects that those objects have on each other in order to obtain more precise and meaningful semantic labels for the whole images. However, the proposed method is not restricted to the specific region-based approach used in this paper. Rather, the proposed method can be applied in any region-based image retrieval systems.

In this paper, a two-step surface patterning is employed with the focus on understanding angular light diffractions from both nanopatterns and truncated microdomes. Light output enhancement of the LEDs with hybrid surface texturing is investigated experimentally and theoretically. The results suggest that light is diffracted through the grating effect and curved sidewalls when interacting with truncated microdomes, resulting in a maximum enhancement 64° away from the normal surface. On the other hand, nearly omni-directional enhancement was found from the randomly scattered nanopatterns. As for the hybrid structure, since guided modes in the semiconductor layers are diffracted by either nanopatterns or microdomes, the percentage increase of light extraction from the hybrid structure is approximately the linear superposition of both types of surface textures. The results suggest an interesting guideline to improve LED light output and to adjust angular radiation with the mutlistep surface patterning.',\n",

The operation principle of the splitter is that only one of the super-modes splitting from the directional coupler can propagate through coupling region in the frequency range of interest. The radius of air holes next to the guiding region in coupling region is increased to avoid the acute back reflection at the entrance to the input waveguide induced by the modes mismatch between the input waveguide and coupling region. While in output region, the radius of these corresponding air holes is also increased so that the two splitting super-modes have same propagation constants to avoid the coupling between the two output waveguides. Moreover, as the length of coupling region is varied, its influence on the splitting performance is discussed, and it is verified that the relationship between the splitter length and bandwidth has a trade-off.',\n",

Automatic routine discovery goes beyond low-level activity recognition such as sitting or standing and analyzes human behaviors at a higher level (e.g., commuting to work). With recent developments in ubiquitous sensor technologies, it becomes easier to acquire a massive amount of sensor data. One main line of research is to mine human routines from sensor data using parametric topic models such as latent Dirichlet allocation. The main shortcoming of parametric models is that it assumes a fixed, pre-specified parameter regardless of the data. Choosing an appropriate parameter usually requires an inefficient trial-and-error model selection process. Furthermore, it is even more difficult to find optimal parameter values in advance for personalized applications.

Our approach is evaluated on public datasets in two routine domains: a 34-daily-activity dataset and a transportation mode dataset. Experimental results show that our nonparametric framework can automatically learn the appropriate model parameters from sensor data without any form of model selection procedure and can outperform traditional parametric approaches for human routine discovery tasks.',\n",

It is shown that for MIMO two-way relaying, the minimum distance of the effective constellation at the relay becomes zero when all the rows of the channel fade coefficient matrix belong to a finite number of vector subspaces referred to as the singular fade subspaces. The singular fade subspaces can be classified into two kinds based on whether their harmful effects can be removed or not: (i) the removable and (ii) the non-removable singular fade subspaces. It is shown that network coding maps obtained by the completion of appropriate partially filled Latin Rectangles can remove the harmful effects of all the removable singular fade subspaces. For 2λ-PSK signal set, the removable and non-removable singular fade subspaces are characterized and, it is shown that the number of non-removable singular fade subspaces is a small fraction of the total number of singular fade subspaces and this fraction tends to zero as the constellation size tends to infinity. The Latin Rectangles for the case when the end nodes use different number of antennas are shown to be obtainable from the Latin Squares for the case when they use the same number of antennas. Also, the network coding maps which remove all the removable singular singular fade subspaces are shown to be obtainable from a small set of Latin Squares. The removal of all the singular fade subspaces by properly choosing the network coding map, provides a gain of 5.5 dB over the conventional Exclusive-OR network coding, in a Rayleigh fading scenario with 2 antennas at the end nodes and one antenna at the relay node, for 4-PSK signal set.',\n",

The method offers two major advantages. First it evaluates the closed loop transfer function, which inherently takes into account the impedance mismatch between the elements of the loop and the nonlinear behavior of the active device. These factors affect the loaded quality factor of the frequency stabilization element, as well as the location of frequency at which minimum phase noise is obtained. Secondly the method uses complex quality factor to estimate the frequency of best phase noise performance. Unlike the conventional quality factor which only uses the derivative of phase response, complex quality factor takes into account both amplitude and phase variations and provide better insight for low noise design. It has been shown experimentally that complex quality factor changes significantly for saturated loop. By using complex quality factor of saturated loop, phase noise performance can be more accurately predicted compared to the methods which do not take saturation effects into account.',\n",

As we race to field AR applications in transportation, we should first consider the perceptual and distraction issues that are known in both the AR and transportation communities, with a focus on the unique and intersecting aspects for driving applications. This paper describes the some opportunities and driver challenges associated with AR applications in the automotive domain. We first present a basic research space to assist in these inquiries, which delineates head-mounted from heads-up and center-mounted displays; video from optical see-through displays; and world-fixed from screen-fixed AR graphics. We then address benefits of AR related to primary, secondary, and tertiary driver tasks as well as driver perception and cognition challenges inherent in automotive AR systems.\",\n",

We propose a reliable color modeling approach in HSI (hue-saturation-intensity) color space while considering intensity information by adopting the B-spline curve fitting to make a mathematical model for statistical characteristics of a color with respect to intensity. It is based on the fact that color distribution of a single-colored object is not invariant with respect to brightness variations even in the HS (hue-saturation) plane. The statistical characteristics contain the mean and standard deviation of hue and saturation with respect to intensity. They are mathematically expressed as four bar graphs. In order to fit the bar graphs to continuous curves, we use B-spline curve fitting procedure.

The main obstacle in the use of full-duplex in signal transmission is the self-interference. In this paper, we propose a system model where a copy of the transmitted signal is obtained by an auxiliary receiver and afterwards subtracted from the signal at the ordinary receiver in the same User Equipment. This requires the knowledge of the correlation in between the channels of the two receivers. We propose to use a Kalman filter for channel estimation, which is derived to estimate the correlated channels of both receivers in the presence of two types of noise. The first one is the additive Gaussian noise, while the second one is the transceiver noise which results from impurities of the transmitter and receiver components. This scenario allows for a more comprehensive analysis of self-interference cancellation. We utilize the bit error rate of the transmission to study its performance in the cases of perfect channel state information, Kalman filter channel estimation and Least Square Estimation (LSE). It is shown that, the bit error rate when using Kalman filter is lower than when using LSE. The combination of using a Kalman filter as the channel estimator together with an auxiliary receiver also enhances the data rate.',\n",

We propose a fully distributed contention window adaptation (CWA) mechanism, which adjusts the channel access probability depending on the difference between the incoming and outgoing traffic at each node, in order to equate the traffic forwarding capabilities among all the nodes in the path. We implement the proposed adaptive contention algorithm on Madwifi Linux kernel driver for Wi-Fi interface with Atheros chipset and carry out an empirical study in our division building. The experiment results demonstrate how the proposed mechanism can improve end-to-end throughput performance in the multihop wireless networks.',\n",

The effects on performance of platform displacement from its desired location with both fixed and steerable antennas are also examined. It is shown that steerable antennas are of most use when fixed stations are immediately below the platform, with no benefit for fixed stations on the edge of coverage.

In this paper, we study the traffic-demand-based cooperation strategy of SUs in multichannel CRNs, in which each SU makes its own cooperative sensing decision according to its traffic demand. When an SU has high traffic demand, it can choose to sense multiple channels in the sensing period and obtain more chances to use spectrum resources. If an SU has no data to transmit, it can choose not to perform spectrum sensing. We formulate this problem as a nontransferable utility (NTU) overlapping coalitional game. In this game, each SU implements a cooperation strategy according to its expected payoff, which takes into account the expected throughput and energy efficiency. We propose two different algorithms, namely, an overlapping coalition formation (OCF) algorithm and a sequential coalition formation (SCF) algorithm, to obtain a coalition structure. The OCF algorithm guarantees that the coalition structure is stable, whereas the SCF algorithm has lower computational complexity and less information exchange among SUs. Moreover, when being assigned a certain channel, SU implements an adaptive transmission power control scheme to further improve its energy efficiency.

There are various ways to order multiple conflicting access requests like FIFO and timestamp ordering (TO) schemes. For example, an object is exclusively used by each transaction in locking protocols. In scheduling algorithms, highly prioritized processes are performed before lower ones. Thus, it is critical to discuss which access request should be performed before another. In this paper, we postulate that an access request issued by a more significant subject for a more significant purpose should be performed prior to less significant access requests. In the role-based access control model, a role is a set of access rights, which shows a job function in an enterprise. A subject is first granted a role from another subject. Only a subject granted a role can issue an access request in the role. In this paper, the significancy of subject and purpose is defined in terms of roles and authorization relations. Here, there are two views, subject-oriented (SO) and purpose-oriented (PO) views to order transactions. A method issued by a subject with more significant roles should be performed before another conflicting method issued by a less significant subject in the SO view.

This letter proposes a new trilateral teleoperation scheme for haptic teleoperation control of a WMR (slave) with longitudinal slippage. In this teleoperation system, a virtual model (predictor) of the slave WMR is utilized at the master site to guide the human operator to issue more effective commands and, by mediating between the master and the slave WMR, ensure that unsafe maneuvers are not performed by the WMR. Besides compensation for the WMR/terrain's nonpassivity caused by the slippage, a shared control is proposed for the system. Theoretically, the system's stability is shown via its passivity and it is shown that the force felt by the human operator is approximately equal to the forces applied by the environment of the predictor plus that of the slave robot, which is a satisfactory performance outcome. Experiments of the proposed WMR teleoperation system demonstrate that it results in stable trilateral teleoperation with a satisfactory tracking performance.

However, its performance degrades significantly while multiple access interference (MAI) is present. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity adaptive filtering scheme to solve the problem. The proposed scheme comprises two adaptive filters, an adaptive spatial and an adaptive temporal filter. With a special structure, the spatial filter can act as a beamformer suppressing interference, while the temporal filter can act as a code-delay estimator. A criterion is proposed for minimization such that these filters can simultaneously adjusted by a constrained least-mean-square (LMS) algorithm. The proposed system is simple and it can acquire both the code-delay and direction-of-arrival (DoA) of the desired user. The performance as well as the convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm is analyzed. Closed-form expressions for optimum filters and steady-state mean-squared errors (MSE) are derived. Computer simulations show that the mean acquisition time of the proposed system is much shorter than that of the conventional system',\n",

In the proposed sharing, a source node and two sink nodes send the information conveying signal and the artificial noises to relay station, simultaneously for avoiding decoding the information in the untrusted relay. After amplifying and forwarding relay, the two nodes do not decode the information from the received signal without removing artificial noises. The untrusted relay constructs the null steering with two antennas for removing the artificial noise. Since the channel transfer functions through which the two artificial noises are passed are common, the null points to two sink nodes can be constructed. As a result, the two nodes can remove the artificial noises. This null steering is mirroring null steering.

First, the phenomena of power coupling under a non-ideal power grid, and the circuits with an active power decoupling method are derived. By introducing a ratio factor between dc bus capacitors, the decoupling ability in the proposed method can be improved. In order to achieve accurate power decoupling, a neural filter is adopted for clearly identifying the dc bus voltage level and extracting the ripple voltage on the dc bus. In addition, a total sliding-mode controller is further designed in the control strategy to enhance the system robustness with respect to varied power coupling conditions, e.g., under ideal or distorted power grids.

The constraints are enforced along the surfaces of e.g. elastic bodies under consideration. Standard constraint algorithms include penalty methods, Lagrange multiplier methods and combinations thereof. For complex scenarios, a major part of the solution time is taken up by operations to identify points that come into contact. This paper presents a novel approach to model frictionless contact using high order finite elements. Here, we employ an especially designed material model that is inserted into two- respectively three-dimensional regions surrounding contacting bodies. Contact constraints are thus enforced on the same manifold as the accompanying structural problem. The application of the current material formulation leads to a regularization of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. Our formulation can be classified as a barrier-type method. Results are obtained for two- and three-dimensional problems, including a Hertzian contact problem. Comparisons to a commercial FEA package are provided. The proposed formulation works well for non-matching discretizations on adjacent contact interfaces and handles self-contact naturally.

In such work, a crucial role is played by the notion of attack between arguments, and the notion of attack is well-studied. There is, for example, a range of different approaches to identifying which of a set of arguments should be accepted given the attacks between them. Less well studied is the notion of support between arguments, yet the idea that one argument may support another is very intuitive and seems particularly relevant in the area of decision-making where decision options may have multiple arguments for and against them. In the last decade, the study of support in argumentation has regained attention among researchers, but most approaches address support in the context of abstract argumentation where the elements from which arguments are composed are ignored. In contrast, this paper studies the notion of support between arguments in the context of structured argumentation systems where the elements from which arguments are composed play a crucial role. Different forms of support are presented, each of which takes into account the structure of arguments; and the relationships between these forms of support are studied. Then, the paper investigates whether there is a correspondence between the structured and abstract forms of support, and determines whether the abstract formalisms may be instantiated using concrete forms of support in terms of structured arguments. The conclusion is that support in structured argumentation does not mesh well with support in abstract argumentation, and this suggests that more work is required to develop forms of support in abstract argumentation that model what happens in structured argumentation.',\n",

In CR environment, many secondary users (SU) share the available spectrum and the SU shall properly select the channel to avoid congestion on the same channel so that the throughput can be maximized. This paper proposes a systematic method to select channel for better transmission performance. A fusion center (FC) is assumed to collect the channel information sent by SUs and decides the channel for the SU that issues the transmission request. The proposed schemes adopt the weight based concept to choose the appropriate channel for the SU. Two strategies, which are the egoistic approach and the cooperative approach, are proposed in this paper to maximize the individual transmission rate and overall system throughput, respectively. Exhaustive simulations were carried out to examine the performance of the proposed schemes. The simulation results show that the proposed schemes have better performance when compared to the other scheme.',\n",

Most research on scheduling workflows has focused on the offline problem of minimizing the make span of single workflows with known task runtimes. The problem of scheduling multiple workflows has been addressed either in an offline fashion, or still with the assumption of known task runtimes. In this paper, we study the problem of scheduling workloads consisting of an arrival stream of workflows without task runtime estimates. The resource requirements of a workflow can significantly fluctuate during its execution. Thus, we present four scheduling policies for workloads of workflows with as their main feature the extent to which they reserve processors to workflows to deal with these fluctuations. We perform simulations with realistic synthetic workloads and we show that any form of processor reservation only decreases the overall system performance and that a greedy backfilling-like policy performs best.',\n",

Using an appropriate model of computation helps to reason about the system and enables design time analysis methods. The nature of multimedia processing matches in many cases well with cyclo-static dataflow (CSDF), making it a suitable model. However, channels in an implementation often use for cost reasons a kind of shared buffer that cannot be directly described in CSDF. This paper shows how such implementation specific aspects can be expressed in CSDF without the need for extensions. Consequently, the CSDF graph remains completely analyzable and allows reasoning about its temporal behavior. The obtained relation between model and implementation enables a buffer capacity analysis on the model while assuring the throughput of the final implementation. The capabilities of the approach are demonstrated by analyzing the temporal behavior of an MPEG-4 video encoder with a CSDF graph.',\n",

A proof-of-principle version of a conventional combiner was fabricated and tested at TRW, and the limitations of this approach will be discussed and contrasted with the more novel compensated grating rhomb technique. 1. Semiconductor laser diodes are attractive sources for a space-based laser communications system because they have been shown to be reliable at low powers, are easily modulated, and are relatively compact with minimal drain on the spacecraft prime power subsystem. However, until the advent of reliable, diffraction-limited diode arrays, the highest power single emitter currently available in sample quantities is Matsushita Electric Corporation's (MEC) 100 mW Buried Twin Ridge Substrate (BTRS) 860 nm GaAlAs laser with a nonabsorbing mirror (NAM) structure.1 Higher power single emitters, broad area devices, and linear arrays have demonstrated reliability but are not diffraction limited.

Several incoherent power combining (summing) schemes have been discussed in the literature.2/ 3 The approach taken here is similar to that of Minott4 at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.

However, achieving a high accuracy in this purpose may pose many problems in ultra-wideband (UWB) applications.

To overcome this challenge, the authors incorporate a robust estimation approach and supplementary sampling process in a unified algorithm to retrieve time delays from signals with low sampling rates. Toward that pursuit, a model based least squares estimator is proposed as the main approach to calculate time delays and a modified method based on multiple signal classification (MUSIC) is also presented for comparison aim.

However, such selfishness and noncooperation deteriorate both the system efficiency and nodes' performances. Moreover, the distributed nodes with only local information may not know the cooperation point, even if they are willing to cooperate. Hence, it is crucial to design a distributed mechanism for enforcing and learning the cooperation among the greedy nodes in packet forwarding. In this paper, we propose a self- learning repeated-game framework to overcome the problem and achieve the design goal. We employ self-transmission efficiency as the utility function of individual autonomous node. The self transmission efficiency is defined as the ratio of the power for self packet transmission over the total power for self packet transmission and packet forwarding. Then, we propose a framework to search for good cooperation points and maintain the cooperation among selfish nodes. The framework has two steps: First, an adaptive repeated game scheme is designed to ensure the cooperation among nodes for the current cooperative packet forwarding probabilities. Second, self-learning algorithms are employed to find the better cooperation probabilities that are feasible and benefit all nodes. We propose three learning schemes for different information structures, namely, learning with perfect observability, learning through flooding, and learning through utility prediction. Starting from noncooperation, the above two steps are employed iteratively, so that better cooperating points can be achieved and maintained in each iteration. From the simulations, the proposed framework is able to enforce cooperation among distributed selfish nodes and the proposed learning schemes achieve 70% to 98% performance efficiency compared to that of the optimal solution.\",\n",

Available Web page models, which are also used widely in content extraction and automatic wrapper algorithms, include text model, document object model, and vision-based page segmentation model. Because of existing models focus on Web structure rather than semantic relevance, they are difficult to be directly used for PIE. To deal with this problem, we introduce the sequence block model (SBM), by which is easy to determine the relevance of each page block to the retrieval name. Then, we give the definition of PIE based on the SBM. Depending on the sequence correlation of SBM, we design a 4-layer seq2seq deep learning network for PIE. Experiment result shows that our new model extracts twice as much data as content extraction algorithms. And the recall rate of the network is 7% higher than the traditional model with classification algorithm.',\n",

In order to make full use of advantages of four-layer laser, we designed a special calibration board, which allows us to solve unique solution by using P6P algorithm with only three different postures. The precision of solutioin depends on accuracy of feature points, which can be affected by following reasons. 1) Lack of optimization on extracted features points. Because the interval between adjacent scan points, which may not just fall on the edge of slit, is about 20mm, so deviation range of the feature points in Y axis direction of the radar coordinate is about 0~10mm. 2) The extracted feature points are approximate. Because the ideal feature point should be located in the middle of the edge of slit, of which the width is 5mm, so deviation range of the feature points in Z axis direction of the radar coordinate is about 0~3mm. The experimental results show that the average projection error is about 30pixels, while that of which in the state of the art achieve 6pixels[1], which is mainly occured by no optimal processing.

When strongly localized perturbations are applied, it is shown that the vortex relaxes to axisymmetry in a time proportional to $${Re^{2/3}}$$Re2/3 , which is substantially shorter than the diffusion time scale given by the viscosity. This enhanced dissipation effect is due to the differential rotation inside the vortex core. Our result relies on a recent work by Li et\\xa0al.

This problem is formulated as a problem of channel reduction in hyperspectral images, which is performed by replacing subsets of adjacent spectral bands by their means. An optimal partition of hyperspectral bands is obtained by minimizing the Maximum of Mahalanobis Norms (MXMN) of errors, obtained due to misrepresentation of hyperspectral bands by constants. By minimizing the MXMN of errors, one reduces the anomaly contribution to the errors, which allows to retain more anomaly-related information in the reduced channels. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithm produces better results, in terms of the Receiver Operation Characteristic (ROC) curve of a benchmark anomaly detection algorithm (RX) - applied after the dimensionality reduction, as compared to two other dimensionality reduction techniques, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA).',\n",

In particular, we consider a setup where each node has an initial value and the goal is for (a subset of) the nodes to calculate a function of these values in a distributed manner. We focus on linear iterative strategies for function calculation, where each node updates its value at each time-step to be a weighted average of its own previous value and those of its neighbors; after a sufficiently large number of time-steps, each node is expected to have enough information to calculate the desired function of the initial node values. We study the susceptibility of such strategies to misbehavior by some nodes in the network; specifically, we consider a node to be malicious if it updates its value arbitrarily at each time-step, instead of following the predefined linear iterative strategy. If the connectivity of the network topology is 2f or less, we show that it is possible for a set of f malicious nodes to conspire in a way that makes it impossible for a subset of the other nodes in the network to correctly calculate an arbitrary function of all node values. Our analysis is constructive, in that it provides a specific scheme for the malicious nodes to follow in order to obfuscate the network in this fashion.',\n",

We consider two network architectures: local sources (LS) at each optical network unit (ONU) versus a single source located at the central office. We examine both architectures over a 20-km optical link, as well as a reference back-to-back configuration. Our architectures can adopt two-feeder and single-feeder topologies; however, we only test the two-feeder topology and therefore the effect of Rayleigh backscattering is neglected. We also study the relative merits (cost and performance) of local sources versus centralized architectures. A penalty of less than 2 dB between the LS and the centralized light sources (CLS) architectures was measured at a bit error rate (BER) of 10-9 under certain assumptions on the relative power of the sources. The power budget in the CLS architectures is more critical than in the LS architectures; extra splitting and propagation losses exist as the uplink travels through the network back and forth. Doubling the number of users while maintaining the same distance and source power in LS architectures imposes 3-dB additional losses, whereas for CLS architectures, there are 6-dB extra losses. CLS architectures can overcome these penalties using amplification at the central office. Alternately, central office amplification can be used to more than double the number of users in LS SAC-OCDMA PONs. A standalone (no global clock) burst-mode receiver with clock and data recovery (CDR), clock and phase alignment (CPA), and Reed-Solomon RS(255,239) forward-error correction (FEC) decoder is demonstrated. A penalty of less than 0.25 dB due to the nonideal sampling of the CDR is reported. The receiver also provides an instantaneous phase acquisition time for any phase step between consecutive packets, and a good immunity to silence periods. A coding gain of more than 2.5 dB was reported for a single-user system, and BER floors were completely eliminated. Error-free transmission (BER < 10-9 ) for a fully loaded PON was achieved for the LS architecture as well as the CLS architecture. Continuous and bursty upstream traffic were tested. Due to the CPA algorithm, even with zero preamble bits we report a zero packet loss ratio (PLR) for up to four simultaneous users in case of bursty traffic, and more than two orders of magnitude improvement in the PLR for fully loaded PON systems.',\n",

              " 113225: 'Because of the wide use of randomized scheduling in concurrency testing research, it is important to understand randomized scheduling and its limitations. This work analyzes how randomized scheduling discovers concurrency bugs by focusing on the probabilities of the two possible orders of a pair of events. Analysis shows that the disparity between probabilities can be large for programs that encounter a large number of events during execution. Because sets of ordered event pairs define conditions for discovering concurrency bugs, this disparity can make some concurrency bugs highly unlikely. The complementary nature of the two possible orders also indicates a potential trade-off between the probability of discovering frequently-occurring and infrequently-occurring concurrency bugs. To help address this trade-off in a more balanced way, randomized-stride scheduling is proposed, where scheduling granularity for each thread is adjusted using a randomized stride calculated based on thread length. With some assumptions, strides can be calculated to allow covering the least likely event pair orders. Experiments confirm the analysis results and also suggest that randomized-stride scheduling is more effective for discovering concurrency bugs compared to the original randomized scheduling implementation, and compared to other algorithms in recent literature.',\n",

              " 572391: 'Recent information theoretic results suggest that in richly scattered wireless environments, systems with multiple transmit and multiple receive antennas (MIMO systems) can have very large capacities. In particular, Foschini and Gans [l] considered a channel with nt transmit and n, receive antennas, with Rayleigh flat faded channel gains i.i.d. across antenna pairs, and showed that at high SNR, the capacity of this channel grows like min(nt, n,) log SNR for large SNR. This yields a min{nt, n,}-fold increase in capacity over a channel with a single transmit and a single receive antenna. The parameter min{nt,n,} can be interpreted as the number of degrees of freedom (d.0.f.) of the channel: the dimension of the space over which communication can take place. The above result assumes that the receiver can perfectly track the fading gains of the channel (so-called perfect channel state information CSI at the receiver). In high mobility applications, this may not be a reasonable assumption. Moreover, in the high SNR regime where the amount of noise is small, it is conceivable that the impact of channel uncertainty on performance is more pronounced. This leads to the question: what is the high SNR capacity of time-varying fading channels without the prior assumption of CSI? Towards this end, Lapidoth and Moser [2], building on earlier work by Taricco and Elia [3], recently showed a contrasting result: that at high SNR, the fmt order term of the capacity is log log SNR, regardless of what the number of transmit and receive antennas is. Thus, not only does capacity grow much slower than in the case with perfect CSI, but this result also suggests that without CSI, the performance gain from having multiple antennas, if any, will only appear as a second-order effect. The increase in the number of the degrees of freedom has minimal impact. Does this then suggest that the perfect CSI results are very fragile? Even though [2] explicitly incorporates the channel variation (and the associated uncertainty) in its model, this result is still asymptotic in the SNR and thus one has to be care ful in interpreting its regime of validity. In particular, since the channel variation process is k e d while the SNR is taken to infinity, it is conceivable that the 1oglogSNR growth only occurs when the noise level is much smaller than the amount of channel variation from one sample to the next. However, typical wireless channels are underspread, which means that this variation is small. Thus, one has to look at the effect of the SNR and the amount of channel variation simultaneously to get a more complete picture. In this work, we would like to put forth such a picture. Suppose the fading process for each channel gain is Gauss-Markov and define SPR to be the inverse of the one-step MMSE prediction error. For underspread channels, SPR is large. We',\n",

The optimal internal force promotes the stability of prehension, while the conventional method sometimes result in too much internal force and reduce the stability.

The system employs a hardware mechanism that is local to each physical connection, which provides a distributed solution for fault detection and isolation. By isolating faults and the use of adaptive routing algorithms, networks may be designed that will maintain operability in the presence of faults. An explanation of the basic switch and fault isolation mechanism is provided. The paper concludes with implementation details of the operational hardware and details of the environment, in which it has been tested.',\n",
              " 306057: 'In recent years, communications equipment including a personal mobile phones which used in a human body neighbourhood increases. The mobile phones are often used in a neighbourhood of human body. It is considered that a part of the radiated electromagnetic wave by mobile phones is absorbed into the human body. In order to analyse interaction between electromagnetic wave and human body a lot of researches have been performed. The quantity of energy absorption is evaluated by using SAR. SAR can be obtained by electric field as SAR = σ E2/ρ [w/kg] (1) Where ρ is density, E is electric field (rms), σ is conductivity. There are three types of SAR measurement techniques, one of which is point SAR measurement technique. Point SAR can be measured easily by using electric field probe or temperature sensor. In the case of using temperature sensor, SAR can be estimated by SAR = c ΔT/Δt [w/kg] (2) Where c is specific heat, ΔT is temperature elevation, Δt is heating time. Another type of SAR measurement techniques is surface SAR distribution. The surface SAR distribution can be measured by using thermography camera. Last SAR measurement technique is whole body SAR. Whole body SAR is total absorption power of target as human body. In order to measure whole body SAR, some techniques have been proposed. One of techniques is using electric field probe and scanning it. This technique can apply for only liquid type target as liquid phantom because the probe cannot scan if the target is solid. Another method is measuring total radiated power (TRP). A radiated power is absorbed by the human body. Therefore a part of radiated power is disappearing due to absorption by the human body. If TRP and input power of the antenna are known then WB-SAR can be measured by comparing these powers. This techniques is well known as measurement of antenna efficiency. However, large-scale equipment is required to measure TRP as 3-dimensional field scanner. Furthermore, huge measurement time is needed due to 3-dimensinal TRP measurement. Therefore a measurement technique of WB-SAR is not established yet. On the other hand, Wheeler cap method is well known as antenna efficiency measurement technique. Reflection coefficient of the antenna and shielding cap are used to measure antenna efficiency in the Wheeler cap method. This technique does not require large-scale equipment. The authors have proposed effective whole body SAR measurement technique by using wheeler cap method for small size phantom. In this paper, the proposed method is expanded to human head size phantom. Effectiveness of the method is confirmed by FDTD simulation.',\n",

The agents are thought to hold uninformative probabilistic prior beliefs about an issue that concerns them and learn about this state of the world through a non-Bayesian myopic DeGroot-style update process applied on the priors using social influence 'mixtures'. We model external information sources in this framework as entities that can bring to the attention of agents 'global' beliefs that are potentially from beyond the confines of a community, and may well be in conflict among themselves. In our model agents score these information sources on the basis of how closely the beliefs propounded by the sources match their own beliefs, but determine how to assimilate such beliefs on the basis of the views of their community of connected neighbors. This form of social learning of external information allows local social influences to carry shared views resulting in the potential emergence of modified homophyllic structures, for example to capture the notion that those who view external information sources in a similar manner might be inclined to demonstrate higher affinities among themselves. We show that this form of social learning of externally expounded beliefs has a learnable dynamic which achieves convergence, and can mirror scenarios where external sources can bring about consensus among opposed cliques, or break emerging consensus.

In the present paper we deal with the above questions in a manner similar to Long (1985), Balcazar (1986), and Long and Selman (1986). We introduce a quantitative restriction on access to a given oracle for probabilistic oracle machines. The restriction, denoted as PR R (·), allows polynomial time-bounded probabilistic oracle machines to query only polynomially many positive strings but exponentially many negative strings in its computation tree. We show that for every oracle A that PP R (NP)( A ) is included in PP( A ). This strengthens the result shown recently by Biegel (1989). In fact, we have their result as an immediate consequence. We next show some positive relativization results on the above questions. We show that seprating PP from PSPACE with some sparse oracle implies the separation of PP from PSPACE in the nonrelativized case. We also show that separating PP from PH with some sparse oracle implies the separation in the nonrelativized case. We also compare D # P and with PH.

This technique is an alternative to the usual 2-tap symbol-spaced FIR (SSF) pre-emphasis. The technique uses timing resolution instead of amplitude resolution to adjust the filter transfer function, and therefore fits well with future high-speed low-voltage CMOS processes. Spectral analysis and time domain simulations illustrate that PWM pre-emphasis offers more relative high frequency boost than 2-tap SSF. Only one coefficient needs to be set to fit the equalizer transfer function to the channel, which makes convergence of an algorithm for automatic adaptation straightforward.

However, attacks have evolved to exploit weaknesses in these defenses. To thwart these attacks, we introduce a novel technique called Instruction Location Randomization (ILR). Conceptually, ILR randomizes the location of every instruction in a program, thwarting an attacker's ability to re-use program functionality (e.g., arc-injection attacks and return-oriented programming attacks). ILR operates on arbitrary executable programs, requires no compiler support, and requires no user interaction. Thus, it can be automatically applied post-deployment, allowing easy and frequent re-randomization. Our preliminary prototype, working on 32-bit x86 Linux ELF binaries, provides a high degree of entropy. Individual instructions are randomly placed within a 31-bit address space. Thus, attacks that rely on a priori knowledge of the location of code or derandomization are not feasible. We demonstrated ILR's defensive capabilities by defeating attacks against programs with vulnerabilities, including Adobe's PDF viewer, acroread, which had an in-the-wild vulnerability. Additionally, using an industry-standard CPU performance benchmark suite, we compared the run time of prototype ILR-protected executables to that of native executables. The average run-time overhead of ILR was 13% with more than half the programs having effectively no overhead (15 out of 29), indicating that ILR is a realistic and cost-effective mitigation technique.\",\n",

In this paper, we propose an error-resilient architecture for Context-Adaptive Variable Length Coding (CAVLC) in H.264/AVC. Due to its context-adaptive nature and intricate control flow CAVLC is very sensitive to soft errors. An error during the CAVLC process (especially during the context adaptation or in VLC tables) may result in severe mismatch between encoder and decoder. The primary goal in our error-resilient CAVLC architecture is to protect codeword/codelength tables and context adaptation in a reliable yet power efficient manner. For reducing the power overhead, the tables are partitioned in various sub-tables each protected with variable-sized parity. Moreover, for further power reduction, our approach incorporates state-retentive power-gating of different sub-tables at run time depending upon the statistical distribution of syntax elements. Compared to the unprotected case, our scheme provides a video quality improvement of 18dB (averaged over various fault injection cases and video sequences) at the cost of a 35% area overhead and 45% performance overhead due to the error-detection logic. However, partitioned sub-tables increase the potential for power-gating, thus bring a leakage energy saving of 58%. Compared to state-of-the-art table protection, our scheme provides 2x reduced area and performance overhead. For functional verification and area comparison, the architecture is prototyped on a Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA, though not limited to it.

Such statements correspond to weight constraints, and thus impact on which project portfolios are potentially optimal or non-dominated in view of the resulting set of feasible attribute weights. In this paper, we extend earlier preference elicitation approaches by allowing the decision maker to make direct statements about the selection and rejection of individual projects. We convert such project preference statements to weight information by determining the weights for which (i) the selected project is included in all potentially optimal or non-dominated portfolios, or (ii) the rejected project is not included in any potentially optimal or non-dominated portfolio. We prove that the two complementary selection rules will exclude exactly the same set of weights. However, analyses that apply the dominance structure often lead to multiple, mutually exclusive feasible weight sets, and therefore the approach based on potential optimality is more relevant for practical decision analysis. We also propose ex ante value of information measures to guide the elicitation of project preference statements, and illustrate our results by analyzing a real case on the selection of infrastructure maintenance projects.',\n",

This paper will discuss the energy efficiency of MIMO systems with antenna selection. The optimal method for the maximization of energy efficiency is exhaustive search. To address the problem, an iterative algorithm which includes the transmit antenna selection and power adaptation is proposed. It is based on the iterative property of the energy efficiency, which is derived in this paper. This property guides us to select the antenna that achieves the largest energy efficiency increment at each step. There is also a power adaptation for each step where we calculate the optimal transmission power and then set it as the initial one for the next step. Moreover, one asymptotic property exists in the proposed algorithm, which states that the antenna selection and power adaptation can be decoupled in high and low SNR regimes. This fact reduces the complexity further and enables us to achieve the optimal performance with a greater probability. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves near-optimal performance in all the SNR regimes and has a remarkable gain over the no selection scheme in the energy efficiency and transmission power.',\n",

The cluster heads advertisements in each virtual grid are supposed to outreach the corresponding grid member nodes. With different competition radius, sensor node in the middle and at the edge of each virtual grid can cover grid members which implies that each cluster head should have variable competition range depending on location in the grid for energy saving. So, in this paper we design cluster head election mechanism and algorithm to decide the transmission range of each cluster head advertisement. For inter cluster communication, to let uniform depletion of energy among sensor nodes, we also derive and mathematically formulate the optimal percentage of packet traffic that should be routed to neighbor and cross level grid.

In addition to studying the aggregated I/O workload that is directed to the storage system, we perform a structural modeling of the workload in order to understand the underlying causes that produce the observed self-similarity.

She assigns each task to a set of workers over the Internet, instead of computing the task locally. For each task each worker reply to the master with the task result. Since the task was not computed locally, the master can not trust the result for two main reasons: (i) workers might deliberately provide an incorrect result, (ii) the result is corrupted due to some hardware or software failure during the execution of the task. Given the above, we can model our workers as either “altruistic”, always willing to provide the correct result to each task, or “troll” that are trying to provide an incorrect result to each task. Moreover we model the failure of the worker to comply with her intended behavior, as an error probability ε. The goal of the master is to compute the correct result of all the tasks with high probability. In the literature two techniques have been used to achieve this goal: (i) “voting”, that determines the correct result of a task given multiple replies of distinct workers; (ii) “challenges”, that are tasks whose result is known and can be used to detect altruistic workers. What separates our work from the current literature is the realistic modelling of the worker's behavior and the fact that we do not restrict the task result to a binary set of answers; the domain of possible replies for a task can have multiple correct and multiple incorrect results. Given the above we evaluate the performance of the two techniques described in the literature in the scenario where ε = 0 and when ε > 0. Performance is measured in terms of: (1) time, i.e., the number of rounds performed by an algorithm for the computation of all the tasks, and (2) work, i.e., the number of total task computations performed by the workers.

The ATRON modules are difficult to control because of complex motion constraints on the modules. Motion constraints are reduced by using meta-modules composed of three modules. A meta-module may emerge from unstructured groups of modules if three modules are connected in the right configuration. The meta-module then moves on a surface of modules and stop at another position. To attract moving meta-modules and thereby to specify the shape-changing task of the robot we use attraction-points. In this work we evolve a distributed artificial neural network controller for the modules. The controller is identical on every module and controls when a meta-module emerges, how it move and when it stops. In simulation we demonstrate how this control strategy allows the ATRON robot to shape-change to support an unstable roof, build a bridge across a gap and to self-repair a broken bone.

Most well-established enhancement techniques with conventional arrays can be adapted into ad hoc scenarios. Despite recent efforts to introduce various ad hoc speech enhancement apparatus, a common framework for integration of conventional methods into this new scheme is still missing. This paper establishes such an abstraction based on inter and intra subarray speech coherencies. Along with measures for signal quality at the input of subarrays, a measure of coherency is proposed both for subarray selection in local enhancement approaches, and also for selecting a proper global reference when more than one subarray are used. Proposed methods within this framework are evaluated with regard to quantitative and qualitative measures, including array gains, the speech distortion ratio, the PESQ measure, and the STOI intelligibility measure. Major findings in this work are the observed changes in the superiority of different methods for certain conditions. When perceptual quality or intelligibility of the speech are the ultimate goals, there are turning points where the MVDR and the LCMV are superior to Wiener-based methods.

This map demonstrates the relationship between all the candidates and the templates, and it is constructed based on the solution to an innovative optimization formulation named multitask reverse sparse representation formulation, which searches multiple subsets from the whole candidate set to simultaneously reconstruct multiple templates with minimum error. A customized APG method is derived for getting the optimum solution (in matrix form) within several iterations. This formulation allows the candidates to be evaluated accurately in parallel rather than one-by-one like most sparsity-based trackers do and meanwhile considers the relationship between candidates, therefore it is more superior in terms of cost-performance ratio. The discriminative information containing in this map comes from a large template set with multiple positive target templates and hundreds of negative templates. A Laplacian term is introduced to keep the coefficients similarity level in accordance with the candidates similarities, thereby making our tracker more robust. A pooling approach is proposed to extract the discriminative information in the DSS map for easily yet effectively selecting good candidates from bad ones and finally get the optimum tracking results.

It aims to enable an automation operator, who most likely is a non-network-expert, to spot anomalies in network traffic and also to memorise past seen anomalies more easily. The developed solution builds upon three components: a Snort event-log forwarder, a database and the 3D fish tank to visualize the events. Different kind of fishes were chosen to present network nodes, and how they move in the fish tank describes the event. Visualization system was implemented using the Unity game engine.

Scans from a 3D LIDAR sensor are split into a set of horizontal layers which are then used for localization with separate instances of an AMCL algorithm. A consistency check is performed for the obtained pose estimates in every time step and feasible results are fused. It is shown, that ML-AMCL is superior to existing localization approaches and is well suited as a prior for 3D point registration algorithms for the refinement of the pose estimate. Our key contributions are: i) proposal of ML-AMCL. ii) Incorporation of prior information from ML-AMCL into different pose refinement procedures, i.e. ICP variants and normal distribution transform (NDT), for precise vehicle localization. By means of experimental evaluation with a challenging real data set, performance of the reference localization system is verified.

To improve the coding efficiency of intra coding, HEVC employs a flexible quad-tree coding block partitioning structure and 35 intra prediction modes. The optimal prediction mode is selected through rough mode decision (RMD) and rate distortion optimisation (RDO) process. Due to the huge search space of all of the possible depth levels (CU sizes) and intra prediction modes, intra coding of HEVC is a very time-consuming and complicated process, which limits the application of HEVC. In order to reduce the intra coding complexity, we propose a fast mode decision algorithm for HEVC intra prediction which is based on dominant edge assent (DEA) and its distribution. The four DEAs in the directions of degree 0, 45, 90 and 135 are computed first; then, the dominant edge is decided according to the minimum DEA. Next, a subset of prediction modes in accordance with the dominant edge is chosen for the RMD process. The rule is as follows: When the standard deviation of DEA is distinctly small, we skip the RMD process and take the direct current (DC) mode and planar modes as the candidate modes for the RDO process; when the minimum DEA is distinctly small, we select seven modes as the candidate modes for the RMD process; otherwise, we select 11 modes for the RMD process. Lastly, the prediction unit (PU) size-based number of RDO candidate modes (3 for PU size 4\\u2009×\\u20094 and 8\\u2009×\\u20098 and 1 for the other PU sizes) is modified according to experimental analysis.

As such, this article presents the most comprehensive study to date by evaluating 33 colour transforms for lip segmentation: 21 channels from seven colour space models (RGB, HSV, YCbCr, YIQ, CIEXYZ, CIELUV and CIELAB) and 12 additional colour transforms (8 of which are designed specifically for lip segmentation). The colour transform comparison is extended to determine the best transform to segment the oral cavity. Histogram intersection and Otsu’s discriminant are used to quantify and compare the transforms. Results for lip–skin segmentation validate the experimental approach, as 11 of the top 12 transforms are used for lip segmentation in the literature. The necessity of selecting the correct transform is demonstrated by an increase in segmentation accuracy of up to three times.

Although the TinyOS concurrency model is easier to reason about than preemptive threads, it can still give rise to undesirable behavior due to unexpected interleavings of related tasks, or unanticipated preemption by interrupt handlers. To aid TinyOS developers in understanding the behavior of their programs we have developed a technique for using the process algebra Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) to model the interactions between TinyOS components, and between an application and the TinyOS scheduling and preemption mechanisms. Analysis of the resulting models can help TinyOS developers to discover and diagnose concurrency-related errors in their designs that might otherwise go undetected until after the application has been widely deployed.

An OFDM signal with high PAPR requires power amplifier@?s (PAs) with large linear operating ranges but such PAs are difficult to design and costly to manufacture. Therefore, to reduce PAPR various methods have been proposed. One of the existing technique to reduce PAPR is partial transmit sequences (PTS). The major drawback of this technique is that it requires transmission of side information (SI) with each OFDM symbol, which results in low bandwidth efficiency. It is hard to recover the side information from the OFDM signal received at the receiver. The two methods, which do not require SI to decode the OFDM symbol at the receiver, are multi-point square mapping combined with PTS (M-PTS) and concentric circle mapping based PTS (CCM-PTS). In this paper, the SER performance of PTS based methods namely CCM-PTS and M-PTS over AWGN channel is mathematically analyzed. The SER performance of CCM-PTS over AWGN is analyzed using two decoding techniques, namely minimum distance decoding and circular boundary decoding, whereas M-PTS is analyzed using minimum distance decoding. The simulation results for SER performance of CCM-PTS and M-PTS, over fading channel, have been presented using computer simulations and the SER performance of CCM-PTS by both the decoding techniques is compared with M-PTS. Also, a comparison of PAPR reduction capability and computational complexity of CCM-PTS and M-PTS has been presented. CCM-PTS method almost has the same PAPR reduction capability as M-PTS, but its SER performance is better than M-PTS and uses a simpler method to decode the data symbols.',\n",

Current BMC techniques repeatedly concatenate the original transition relation to unfold the circuit with increasing depths. In this paper we present a method that is based on a dual unfolding scheme. The first unfolding is non-initialized and progressively simplifies concatenated frames of the transition relation. The tail of the simplified frames is then applied in the second unfolding, which starts from the initial state and checks the properties. We use a circuit graph representation for all functions and perform simplification by merging vertices that are functionally equivalent under given input constraints. In the noninitialized unfolding, previous time frames progressively tighten these constraints thus leading to an asymptotic simplification of the transition relation. As a side benefit, our method can find inductive invariants constructively by detecting when vertices are functionally equivalent across time frames. This information is then used to further simplify the transition relation and, in some cases, prove unbounded correctness of properties. Our experiments using industrial property checking problems demonstrate that the presented method significantly improves the efficiency of BMC.',\n",

As the scale of real-world networks becomes increasingly larger, the existing network clustering algorithms fail to discover meaningful clusters efficiently. In this paper, we propose a framework called AnySCAN, which applies anytime theory to the structural clustering algorithm for networks (SCAN). Moreover, an active learning strategy is proposed to advance the refining procedure in AnySCAN framework. AnySCAN with the active learning strategy is able to find the exactly same clustering result on large-scale networks as the original SCAN in a significantly more efficient manner. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic networks demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing network clustering approaches.',\n",
              " 693200: 'Routing is a challenging issue in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) due to their inherent memory and energy constraints. Multicast Routing is used when dealing with group communication and it is well used in WSNs because it improves efficiency and reduces path length in the network. ZigBee is a standard protocol that presents a very prominent technology for WSNs. Z-Cast is a multicast mechanism that has been proposed for ZigBee cluster-tree WSNs. However, this mechanism was not tested on a real WSN platform and presents some gaps related to its memory and communication. In addition, the performance of this mechanism has not been evaluated. In this paper, we address these problems and present an amelioration of this protocol. In addition, we integrate this mechanism in Open-ZB toolset as this implementation does not consider multicast routing in its specification. The main contributions of this paper are two folded: first, we propose an amelioration of Z-Cast that may improve its efficiency and reduce its memory cost. Second, we integrate this protocol in Open-ZB and evaluate its performance on telosB motes.',\n",
              " 224262: \"The monitoring of hydro-energetic dams implies the permanently checking of the physical parameters that affect its safety. The precision of monitoring depends on the measurement accuracy of the electronic systems. The improper functioning conditions of the measuring system prompt for some sensors the appearance of nonsystematic error. The detection and analysis of these errors has been done. In this paper a method for verifying the correction of temperature measurement is shown. The adjustment of dates is obtained using a correlation method which likens the evolution of temperature from inside of building to a polynomial function. To verify this correction method, the data obtained after processing can be correlated with ambient temperature and with temperature measured by the neighboring sensors. After processing the above mentioned data a correlation value is obtained plusmn1. This value indicates that the sensor's function has a very close following of the ambient temperature function and the neighboring sensor's function. To improve the results obtained using the correlation method an additional filter is applied to the data source.\",\n",

Since wireless sensors are limited in power, it is essential to design energy efficient WSNs protocols.

Identifying unintentional RFI signals (for example, from equipment operating in the vicinity of radio telescopes) is a challenging topic due to the highly non-ergodic nature of such signals. Another non-ergodic signal type which has been very well researched is human speech, for which hidden Markov model-based approaches have led to some of the best performing classification algorithms. Inspired by this, in this work, we propose the use of HMMs to identify transient RFI events.

We demonstrate that basic HMMs can be used to classify different RFI events according to their sources in the time-domain, providing useful levels of accuracy.',\n",

              " 181434: 'Fast frequency hopped spread-spectrum is used in military satellite communication systems for providing resilience to different types of jamming. Most analyses focus either on the worst case jamming to obtain performance metrics such as Bit Error Rate (BER), or use specific waveforms and evaluate system performance by means of simulations. Recently there has been a growing interest in using Adaptive Coding and Modulation (ACM) and tune the modulation and coding to specific jamming scenarios, in order to maximize system throughput. This paper provides information theoretic bounds for such systems with wide-band and pulse jammers. Developing these bounds also provide insight into how to construct waveforms which maximize system capacity, while providing the desired jamming resistance. Since fast frequency hopped spread-spectrum systems also typically use Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), there is synchronization overhead. So, information theoretic bounds for capacity, where the transmitter and receiver are not perfectly carrier phase synchronized are also developed. These bounds will prove useful in determining the \"best\" system capacity, which can then be compared with the actual throughput achieved by a specific waveform.',\n",

The uniform nearfield and wavefront are the important part of the beam quality for high power lasers, which is conducive to maintaining the high spatial beam quality in propagation. We demonstrate experimentally that the spatial intensity and wavefront distribution at the output is well compensated in the complex high-power solid-state laser system by using the small-aperture spatial light modulator (SLM) and deformable mirror (DM) in the front stage. The experimental setup is a hundred-Joule-level Nd:glass laser system operating at three wavelengths at 1053 nm (1ω), 527 nm (2ω) and 351 nm (3ω) with 3 ns pulse duration with the final output beam aperture of 60 mm. While the clear arperture of the electrically addressable SLM is less than 20 mm and the effective diameter of the 52-actuators DM is about 15 mm. In the beam shaping system, the key point is that the two front-stage beam shaping devices needs to precompensate the gain nonuniform and wavefront distortion of the laser system. The details of the iterative algorithm for improving the beam quality are presented. Experimental results show that output nearfield and wavefont are both nearly flat-topped with the nearfield modulation of 1.26:1 and wavefront peak-to-valley value of 0.29 λ at 1053nm after beam shaping.',\n",

            "Abstract is :  In this paper, a MIMO Broadcast Channel (MIMO-BC) with large (K) number of users is considered. It is assumed that all users have a hard delay constraint D. We propose a scheduling algorithm for maximizing the throughput of the system, while satisfying the delay constraint for all users. It is proved that by using the proposed algorithm, it is possible to achieve the maximum throughput and maximum fairness in the network, simultaneously, in the asymptotic case of K rarr infin. We introduce a new performance metric in the network, called \"minimum average throughput\", and prove that the proposed algorithm is capable of maximizing the minimum average throughput in a MIMO-BC, in the asymptotic case of K rarr infin. Finally, it is established that the proposed algorithm reaches the boundaries of the capacity region and stability region of the network, simultaneously, in the asymptotic case of K rarr infin.\n",
